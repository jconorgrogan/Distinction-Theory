## 1  Introduction and Purpose
This note sketches how **Informational Constructivism (IC)** might *explain* the appearance of familiar mathematical constants—π, γ, ζ(2), ζ(½), …—instead of accepting them as unexplained axioms.

*   **ISG.md** shows how IC organises the *combinatorial structure* (novelty vs reuse) via the **Integer Structure Grid**.
*   Here we ask: *why do specific numerical parameters or quantitative biases arise inside those structures?*

### Central thesis
For any observer with a finite **Ledger**

\[
C=(M,\;K,\;\tau,\;\varepsilon)
\]

(limitations on memory, description length, compute time, and precision), the drive toward **Simplicity Under Resource-constraint (SUR)** forces it to minimise a stage-dependent cost functional.
Whenever that minimisation bumps up against an *infinite-cost* barrier inherent in information processing, a **rigid residual gap** remains.
That gap’s value is *numerically* one of the familiar constants.

Different optimisation stages → different active Ledgers → different constants.

> **Prerequisites**: Familiarity with IC concepts like Δ-operators (Δ_gen, Δ_proj, Δ_self), base costs (K, E, F_β), the SUR principle, and the ISG.

## 2  Ledger Incompleteness
Because \(C\) is finite, certain “perfect” configurations live behind infinite-cost walls for any realizable observer:

*   **Infinite precision** (distinguishing arbitrarily close states)
*   **Infinite memory**  (storing every detail without compression)
*   **Infinite time**   (exhaustive search / proof)
*   **Perfect symmetry / closure / alignment / smoothness** (no glitches, no gaps, no friction)

These walls define *forbidden regions* in the observer’s state-space, fundamentally inaccessible due to finite `C`.

## 3  SUR Optimisation: Hugging the Finite Coast
At every stage of processing, the observer minimises an active Ledger functional, often taking a form like

\[
L \;=\; K \;+\;\lambda\,E\;+\;\mu\,F_{\beta},
\]

where

*   **K** – description length / Kolmogorov complexity cost
*   **E** – energetic or implementation cost
*   **Fβ** – free-energy penalty for coping with noise/uncertainty

The relative importance (coefficients λ, μ) changes by context (e.g., depending on whether description length, energy expenditure, or noise-handling is the dominant constraint for the task at that stage).
SUR therefore steers the system along the cheapest available “coastline” just inside the infinite-cost cliffs—leaving a *minimal but irreducible* deviation from the inaccessible ideal.

---

## 4  Constants = Necessary Residuals
That irreducible deviation is **not random noise**; its value is mathematically locked in by the specific form of the active Ledger functional \(L\) and the precise nature of the infinite-cost barrier being avoided.
We call the numeric value of this locked-in deviation a **Ledger residual**—which manifests as a fundamental mathematical constant.

## 5  Stage-Dependent Ledgers → Constant Cascade

The structure formation process involves different stages, each potentially optimizing a different Ledger and encountering different barriers, leading to a cascade of constants:

| Stage of Processing         | Dominant Active Ledger Functional           | Infinite-Cost Barrier Skirted                 | Residual / Constant (Hypothesized Link) | Status               |
| :-------------------------- | :---------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------- | :------------------- |
| **1. Raw “Thread”**<br/>(sequential Δ_gen) | \( K_{\text{dir}} + \mu F_{\beta}^{\text{orient}}\)          | Perfect collinearity/alignment of step directions | ζ(½) (via Spiral-of-Theodorus geometry) | *Conjectured*        |
| **2. ISG / Histogram**<br/>(counting types)  | \( K_{\text{counts}} + \lambda E_{\text{storage}}\)     | Perfectly smooth prime-count curve            | γ (Euler–Mascheroni)                    | *Proven in toy models* |
| **3. Lattice / Arithmetic**<br/>(reuse rules)  | \( K_{\text{rules}} + \lambda E_{\text{compute/lookup}}\) | Frictionless closure under +, × (tiling)      | ζ(2)=π²⁄6                              | *Conjectured*        |
| **4. Field-Glue / Geometry**<br/>(merging structures) | Full \(K, E, F_{\beta}\) mix               | Perfect rotational / phase coherence          | π                                       | *Heuristic*          |

*Rows marked “Conjectured” require a full derivation showing the specific constant emerges from the SUR optimization of the proposed Ledger. “Heuristic” implies a plausible link not yet formalized.*

## 6  Residuals as Embedded “Curvature”
Each constant becomes a *rigid quantitative bias* built into the observer’s representational framework at a specific stage. This bias acts like an **effective curvature** or boundary condition.
Higher-level emergent laws (e.g., prime statistics derived from the ISG, analytic continuation properties of functions built on the lattice, potentially geometric field theories) must conform to this underlying landscape shaped by the constants. This perspective explains the ubiquity of the same constants across diverse areas of mathematics and potentially physics – they reflect universal constraints in efficient information processing.

## 7  Summary & Open Programme
*   **Constants are proposed to be Ledger residuals:** They quantify the minimum unavoidable deviation when a finite observer optimizes information processing near an infinite-cost barrier.
*   **Different stages ↔ different Ledgers ↔ different residuals:** The cascade of constants reflects the layered nature of structure building.
*   **Rigidity → Foundational Structure:** These residuals provide a rigid, quantitative scaffolding influencing all subsequent emergent structures and laws.

> **Next steps:** The core research programme involves, for each stage:
> 1.  Formally deriving the *exact structure* of the active Ledger functional \(L\), including demonstrating how terms like the \(F_{\beta}^{\text{orient}}\) angular dependence arise from IC primitives.
> 2.  Solving the corresponding SUR variational problem (minimizing \(L\)) to rigorously *derive* the emergence and value of the associated constant (e.g., proving the ζ(½)-related outcome from the Spiral-of-Theodorus optimization).
