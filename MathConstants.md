# Constants as Ledger-Residuals  
*A Simplicity-Under-Resource account of transcendental numbers*  
 
## 1  Introduction & Critical Assumptions  

Informational Constructivism (IC) proposes that **fundamental constants** arise
as *ledger residuals*: immutable slack left when a finite
information-processing system minimises cost but halts in front of an
**infinite-cost wall**.  This note refines the idea and flags what is proven,
conjectured, or open.

> **Key assumptions (under active investigation)**  
> 1. **Universality** – wall templates are the same for all observers once
>    their ledger budget clears a threshold.  
> 2. **Uniqueness** – each wall supports exactly one SUR optimum.  
> 3. **Weight-independence** – residual values do not depend on arbitrary
>    cost-weights (λ, μ) or those weights are themselves fixed
>    thermodynamically.  

A formal measure-theoretic definition of *wall* and *residual* is in
preparation (see **To-Do 1**); present wording is illustrative.

## 2  Ledger incompleteness & compression walls  

A ledger  
\(C=(M,K,\tau,\varepsilon)\)  
is **incomplete**: pushing any column to infinity is prohibited.

### 2.1  Illustrative wall archetypes  

| Diverging column(s) | Conceptual gap | Prototype wall |
|---------------------|----------------|----------------|
| \(K\!\to\!\infty\) | Polygon → circle | π |
| \(\tau\!\to\!\infty\) | Discrete sum → integral | e, γ |
| \(C_{2}\downarrow,F_{\beta}\downarrow\) | RG fixed point | Feigenbaum δ |
| \(K\!\to\!\infty\) by fiat | Liouville digit rule | any real |

> *Incompressible boundary.*  
> A **compression wall** is the boundary of the region  
> \(\{\,x : L(x)<\infty\}\)  
> in ledger state-space.  **Formalisation is scheduled in *wall.mm* (\*To-Do 1\*).**

## 3  SUR cost & why constants appear  

The base cost forced by monotonicity + additivity is  

\[
L(K,E)=K+\lambda E,
\qquad
\lambda = k_{\!B}T\ln2 .
\]

Near a wall either

* a *single* cost component stalls (π-type residual), or  
* two independent components co-shrink and their **ratio** locks
  (δ-type, candidate for α⁻¹).

### Example: π without sneaking π in  

*Coding cost* \(K(n)=a\log_2 n\) – Kolmogorov bits to state
“regular n-gon”.  
*Error cost* \(E(n)=b\,n^{-2}\) – observer-chosen mean-square radius error.  
Minimising \(L(n)=a\log n+\lambda b n^{-2}\) gives
finite \(n_\star\); adding a side would raise \(K\) faster than it lowers
\(E\).  The unreduced perimeter gap is **π**, produced with no prior mention
of π.  Robustness under any \(E\!\sim\!n^{-p}(p\!>\!1)\) will be proved
(\*To-Do 2\*).

## 4  Status of the α⁻¹ pathway  

| Step | Status |
|------|--------|
| \(C_{2}\) monotonic under Δ_proj | *open theorem* (\*To-Do 4\*) |
| λ̃ flow converges to λ̃★ | *open theorem* |
| Identify EM vacuum as unique rank-1 massless gauge field | *open argument* (\*To-Do 5\*) |
| Dimensional analysis gives \(k_{\!B}T\ln2\,λ̃★ = α^{-1}\) | *conditional result* |

All α⁻¹ claims are therefore **conditional** on these proofs.

---

## 5  BBP digit-extraction criterion (conjecture)  

> **Conjecture.**  
> If a wall shows exact radix-\(b\) self-similarity then its residual admits a
> finite polylog / BBP-type series in base \(b\).
>
> Verified for π (base 16) and ζ(2); proof or counter-example is
> outstanding (\*To-Do 9\*).

## 6  Falsifiability principle  

*Protocol.*  The derivation forbids inserting the target constant into either
\(L\) or wall specification.  Discovery of a ledger-independent constant that
cannot be produced as a residual under any finite ledger would falsify IC’s
claim about constants (\*To-Do 11\*).

---

## 7  Road-map to further constants  

| Constant class | Proposed wall mechanism |
|----------------|-------------------------|
| Newton’s *G* | Curvature-Hessian wall (information metric → spacetime) |
| Cosmological Λ | IR fixed point of \(F_{\beta}\) flow |
| Yukawa masses | Symmetry-breaking compression walls |

Details are future work (\*To-Do 8\*).
