The Core Logic for Emergent Time-Like Order 

Premise 1: The Space of Potential Finite Configurations.
Logical coherence requires the possibility of distinction (rejecting absolute nothing). We posit an atemporal, abstract space containing all possible distinct ways a finite system could be configured. Each "configuration" (or "ledger") is defined by its finite structural and informational properties, most notably its descriptive complexity K (the length of its shortest possible description), its capacity for internal states M, and its precision limits ε.
Premise 2: Internal Reference and Constructive Informational Dependency.
Within the structure of a given configuration (Ledger A), it's possible for patterns to exist that encode or refer to other configurations (Ledger B). This creates the potential for informational dependencies. Specifically, we are interested in constructive dependencies: Configuration A's structure might be characterized by being built upon (e.g., K(A) ≈ K(B) + K(A|B) where B is a sub-component), derived from (A is a transformation of B), or an efficient encoding of (e.g., K(A) < K(B_uncompressed) where A represents the information in B more compactly) a (typically, though not always, K-simpler or precursor) Configuration B. Such dependencies are inherently directed: B → A.
Premise 3: The Principle of Efficient Representation (as an Intrinsic Characteristic).
Not all conceivable configurations are equally "fundamental" or "representative" in how they structure information. We focus on configurations that embody a Principle of Efficient Representation.
Low Descriptive Complexity (K-Efficiency): Configurations are characterized by their ability to represent their internal structure and their constructive dependencies on precursor configurations with relative K-efficiency. This is not a selection process over time, but an intrinsic property: some configurations are simply more descriptively compact and parsimonious than others for the information they embody.
Finite Capacity (C): A fundamental constraint limits the maximum K a configuration can possess or effectively reference. Configurations exceeding these intrinsic bounds are not considered part of the "valid finite configurations."
(Note: This replaces the explicit SUR cost functional L=K+λE for the atemporal foundation, focusing instead on K-efficiency as the primary characteristic. The "cost E" is implicitly addressed by the consequences of striving for K-efficiency, particularly concerning robustness and the nature of encoding.)
Emergence 1: Directed Dependency Chains from Efficient, Constructive Referencing.
Configurations that are K-efficient (embodying the Principle of Efficient Representation), especially complex ones, are often structured such that they constructively reference (as per Premise 2) other, often K-simpler, configurations that also exhibit K-efficiency. This creates directed chains of informational dependency (e.g., ... → C_C → C_B → C_A), where C_A's structure is characterized by being built upon, derived from, or an efficient encoding of C_B's information. The direction arises naturally from these constructive relationships.
Emergence 2: Effective Irreversibility from the Nature of K-Efficient Encoding.
The very act of creating a K-efficient description or representation within a configuration (particularly when representing complex precursor information) often involves abstraction, compression, or algorithmic shortcuts that are not perfectly or uniquely invertible.
If Configuration A is a highly K-efficient encoding of information also present in a less compressed (higher K) Configuration B, then K(B|A) (the complexity of reconstructing the exact B given A) is often large or even undefined (many B's might compress to A).
This inherent "information loss" (from the perspective of perfect reconstruction of the precursor) or the difficulty/impossibility of unique reverse-engineering makes these dependency chains effectively irreversible from an information-theoretic standpoint. One can trace the "construction" from C_B to C_A (given their K-efficient structures) more readily and with less ambiguity than the reverse. This strengthens the directionality of the chain.
Conclusion: Time-Like Order as an Intrinsic Structural Property.
This directed, effectively irreversible chain (or network) of constructive informational dependencies between finite configurations that are characterized by K-efficiency in their representation constitutes an emergent "time-like order."
It is not an external, flowing medium.
It is an intrinsic ordering based on how K-efficient configurations relate to, build upon, and informationally encode one another.
"Memory" is the K-efficiently encoded information within a configuration about its K-simpler or constructive predecessors in the chain.
The "arrow of time" is the inherent directionality of these constructive, K-efficient, and therefore effectively irreversible, dependencies.
In essence: From a timeless landscape of all possible finite ways information could be structured, a Principle of Efficient Representation (favoring low K) characterizes certain configurations. Within this set, configurations are often found to be internally structured such that they refer to, and depend constructively and K-efficiently upon, other configurations. If the nature of achieving high K-efficiency in these referential encodings involves inherent informational loss (from the perspective of precursor reconstruction) or non-unique invertibility, these dependency networks acquire a strong, intrinsic direction. This directed, referential structure, found within the set of K-efficiently characterized configurations, is the emergent time-like order.
