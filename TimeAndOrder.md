**The Core Logic for Emergent Time-Like Order (Atemporal Foundation)**

**Premise 1: The Space of Potential Finite Configurations.**

*   **Foundation in Distinction:** Logical coherence itself necessitates the *possibility* of distinction, as the concept of "absolute nothing" (a state devoid of any distinction) is self-refuting upon assertion. All we require for this premise is logical possibility, not necessarily immediate physical instantiation of all configurations.
*   **Posited Space:** We therefore posit an atemporal, abstract space. This space is not a void but rather a comprehensive domain containing *all possible distinct ways a finite system or informational structure could be configured*.
*   **Nature of Configurations ("Ledgers"):** Each point in this space represents a unique "configuration" (interchangeably, a "ledger"). A configuration is defined by its finite set of structural and informational properties. Key properties include:
    *   **Descriptive Complexity (K):** The length of its shortest possible description (Kolmogorov complexity). Descriptive complexity (K) is taken modulo an $O(1)$ constant that depends on the chosen universal reference machine, and K is formally uncomputable. These caveats do not weaken the argument's structure but are important for formal rigor.
    *   **Capacity for Internal States (M):** The potential richness of its internal distinctions or states.
    *   **Precision Limits (ε):** The bounds on the fineness of distinctions it can represent.
    *   Crucially, each configuration is *finite* in these defining properties. The triad $(K, M, \epsilon)$ serves as a useful, albeit coarse, coordinate system for characterizing these configurations.

**Premise 2: Internal Reference and Constructive Informational Dependency.**

*   **Interconnectedness:** Within the structure of any given configuration (Ledger A), patterns or sub-structures can exist that inherently encode, refer to, or are algorithmically linked to other configurations (Ledger B, Ledger C, etc.). This establishes a network of potential informational dependencies across the space.
*   **Focus on Constructive Dependencies:** We are specifically interested in *constructive* dependencies. These are relationships where Ledger A's structure is characterized by:
    *   Being **built upon** Ledger B (e.g., B is a fundamental sub-component of A). Because shared sub-routines can be factored out during an optimal description, we generally have $K(A) \le K(B) + K(A|B) + c$ (where `c` is a small constant and $K(A|B)$ is the complexity of constructing A given B), and often $K(A) < K(B) + K(A|B) + c$. This includes nested structures where Ledger A might reference Ledger B as an internal component, ideally via a compressed pointer rather than verbatim duplication to maintain overall K-efficiency.
    *   Being **derived from** Ledger B (e.g., A is the result of a specific transformation applied to B).
    *   Being an **efficient encoding of** information also present in Ledger B (e.g., $K(A) < K(B_{\text{uncompressed}})$ where A represents the same core information as an uncompressed B, but more compactly).
*   **Inherent Directionality:** Such constructive dependencies are inherently directed: B → A. Typically, B represents a K-simpler, precursor, or less processed form relative to A in that specific constructive context. (It's worth noting that Kolmogorov complexity defines only a partial order; one can construct examples where $K(B) \approx K(A)$ yet B still functions as a precursor due to specific algorithmic dependency, though the general trend in constructive chains is towards increasing or efficiently maintained complexity).

**Premise 3: The Principle of Efficient Representation (as an Intrinsic Characteristic).**

*   **Intrinsic Parsimony:** Not all conceivable configurations in the vast space are equally "fundamental" or "representative" in how they structure information. We focus on configurations that embody a **Principle of Efficient Representation**. This is not a selection process occurring over time, but an *intrinsic property*: some configurations are simply more descriptively compact and parsimonious than others for the information they embody and the constructive relationships they participate in.
*   **Low Descriptive Complexity (K-Efficiency):**
    *   Configurations are primarily characterized by their ability to represent their internal structure and their constructive dependencies on precursor configurations with relative K-efficiency (minimal $K$).
    *   For a nested or hierarchical configuration to be globally K-efficient, it generally involves efficient referencing of sub-components. While exact global K-optimality might be unattainable or uncomputable for very large structures, we can consider $\epsilon$-optimal hierarchies in practice, where configurations are "efficient enough" for the argument to hold.
*   **Finite Capacity ($C_{K_{\text{max}}}$):** A fundamental constraint limits the maximum descriptive complexity ($K_{\text{max}}$) that any single, valid configuration can possess or effectively reference. This can be seen as reflecting either (a) the bounded resources of any conceivable real encoder or (b) a mathematical restriction to avoid infinitary complications in defining the space. Configurations whose K would exceed this intrinsic bound are not considered part of the set of "valid finite configurations" that can form extended, complex dependency chains. This capacity constraint makes K-efficiency a practical necessity for complexity.
*   **(Note on Implicit Costs):** This atemporal framework focuses on K-efficiency as the primary characteristic for identifying ordered structures. The "costs" typically associated with an $E$ term in dynamic systems (like energy, error, or processing time in the SUR functional $L=K+λE$) are implicitly addressed here by the *consequences* of striving for K-efficiency.

**Emergence 1: Directed Dependency Chains from Efficient, Constructive Referencing.**

*   **Formation of Chains:** Configurations that are K-efficient, particularly those representing substantial information or complexity, are frequently structured such that they constructively reference other, often K-simpler (or comparably K-complex but algorithmically precursor), configurations that also exhibit K-efficiency.
*   **Structure of Chains:** This creates directed chains or, more generally, Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) of informational dependency (e.g., ... → C_C → C_B → C_A). This DAG picture is standard in Algorithmic Information Theory (AIT) treatments of related concepts like causation or mutual information.
*   **Natural Direction:** The directionality of these chains arises naturally from the constructive and K-efficient nature of these dependencies.

**Emergence 2: Effective Irreversibility from the Nature of K-Efficient Encoding.**

*   **Information Transformation:** The very act of creating a K-efficient description or representation (e.g., abstraction, compression, algorithmic shortcuts) often leads to transformations that are not uniquely invertible.
*   **Non-Unique Invertibility:** If Configuration A is a highly K-efficient encoding of information also present in a less compressed Configuration B, then the conditional complexity $K(B|A)$ (the complexity of reconstructing the exact B given A) is often large. Many different B's might compress to A. This difficulty in unique reconstruction is related to Charles Bennett’s notion of *logical depth*: highly compressed objects (low K) often require extensive computation (long logical depth) to decompress or regenerate their less compressed precursors, creating an operational asymmetry that reinforces irreversibility.
*   **Consequence: Effective Irreversibility:** This inherent "information loss" (from the perspective of perfect, unique reconstruction of the exact precursor) or the extreme difficulty of such unique reverse-engineering makes these K-efficient dependency chains **effectively irreversible** from an information-theoretic standpoint. Whenever $K(B|A)$ is large, recovering B from A entails logically-irreversible operations; Landauer’s principle ties that to a minimum thermodynamic cost (at least $kT \ln 2$ per erased bit of specificity about B not contained in A), cementing the arrow’s potential physical bite when such processes are instantiated.

**Conclusion: Time-Like Order as an Intrinsic Structural Property of Information.**

*   **The Emergent Order:** This directed, effectively irreversible DAG of constructive informational dependencies between finite, K-efficient configurations constitutes an emergent **"time-like order."**
*   **Intrinsic, Not External:** This order is not an external, flowing medium. It is an **intrinsic, structural property of the atemporal space of K-efficient configurations themselves**. (This defines a pre-causal ordering; a dynamic observer, like one operating under SUR, would then trace a path through this DAG, thereby recovering conventional, experienced temporality).
*   **"Memory" Redefined:** "Memory" embodied in Configuration A is the K-efficiently encoded information about its K-simpler or constructive predecessors in the dependency chain.
*   **The "Arrow of Time" Redefined:** The "arrow of time" is the inherent, information-theoretically robust directionality of these constructive, K-efficient, and therefore effectively irreversible, dependencies.

**In Essence: From a timeless landscape of all possible finite ways information could be structured, a Principle of Efficient Representation (favoring low K and operating within a $K_{\text{max}}$ capacity) characterizes certain fundamental configurations. Within this set, complex structures are often found to be internally organized such that they refer to, and depend constructively and K-efficiently upon, other K-efficient configurations. The nature of achieving high K-efficiency in these referential encodings often involves inherent informational loss regarding the unique identity of precursors, rendering these dependency networks effectively irreversible and strongly directed. This directed, referential, and effectively irreversible structure, found within the set of K-efficiently characterized configurations, *is* the emergent time-like order – a fundamental ordering inherent in the static architecture of information itself.**
