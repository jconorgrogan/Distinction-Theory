# The Core Logic for Emergent Time-Like Order

## Premise 1: The Space of Potential Finite Configurations

Logical coherence requires the possibility of distinction (rejecting absolute nothing). We posit an atemporal, abstract space containing all possible distinct ways a finite system could be configured. Each "configuration" (or "ledger") is defined by its finite structural and informational properties, most notably:

- Descriptive complexity **K** (length of its shortest possible description)
- Capacity for internal states **M**
- Precision limits **ε**

## Premise 2: Internal Reference and Constructive Informational Dependency

Within a given configuration (Ledger A), patterns may encode or refer to other configurations (Ledger B). This allows **informational dependencies** to arise. We focus on **constructive dependencies**:

- **Built upon**: e.g., K(A) ≈ K(B) + K(A|B), where B is a sub-component
- **Derived from**: A is a transformation of B
- **Efficient encoding**: K(A) < K(B_uncompressed), where A encodes B more compactly

These dependencies are **inherently directed**: B → A.

## Premise 3: The Principle of Efficient Representation (as an Intrinsic Characteristic)

Not all configurations are equally fundamental in how they structure information. Focus is on those exhibiting the **Principle of Efficient Representation**.

- **Low Descriptive Complexity (K-Efficiency)**: Configurations efficiently encode their internal structure and dependencies.
- **Finite Capacity (C)**: A constraint limits the maximum K a configuration can possess or reference. Configurations exceeding this are not valid.

Note: This replaces the explicit SUR cost functional L = K + λE, focusing instead on **K-efficiency**. The "cost E" is implicit in striving for efficient encoding.

## Emergence 1: Directed Dependency Chains from Efficient, Constructive Referencing

K-efficient configurations often constructively reference K-simpler configurations that also exhibit K-efficiency. This leads to **directed chains of dependency**:

    ... → C_C → C_B → C_A

Here, C_A is built upon, derived from, or encodes C_B. The **directionality** follows from the nature of constructive referencing.

## Emergence 2: Effective Irreversibility from the Nature of K-Efficient Encoding

Creating a K-efficient description often involves abstraction or compression that is:

- Not perfectly or uniquely invertible
- Associated with **high or undefined K(B|A)** (complexity of reconstructing B from A)

Thus, information loss or ambiguity in reverse-engineering leads to **effective irreversibility** in the dependency chain. The direction from C_B to C_A is more tractable than the reverse.

## Conclusion: Time-Like Order as an Intrinsic Structural Property

These **directed**, **irreversible** chains of constructive, K-efficient dependencies define an **emergent time-like order**.

- It is **not** an external medium.
- It arises from **intrinsic relationships** between configurations based on K-efficiency.
- **Memory** is K-efficient encoding of simpler predecessors.
- The **arrow of time** is the direction of effectively irreversible constructive dependencies.

**Summary**:

From the space of all possible finite informational structures, configurations that satisfy the Principle of Efficient Representation are structured to refer to and depend on K-simpler configurations. If encoding efficiency entails informational loss or non-unique invertibility, then dependency chains gain a strong directionality. This directionality within the space of valid K-efficient configurations constitutes an emergent, intrinsic time-like order.
