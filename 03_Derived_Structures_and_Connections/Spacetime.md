The ISG and Space-Time in IC
*(Note: "ISG" here primarily refers to the Prime-Factorization ISG model, see `IC_ISG_Definition.md`. For general ISG levels, see `03_Derived_Structures_and_Connections/IC_ISG_Levels_and_Algorithmic_Interpretations.md`)*
* ISG represents how structures resist compression using two coarse coordinates:
    * x (Max Reuse Depth): Resistance due to deep recursive reuse (linked to E, τ, ε, C₂)
    * y (Total Primitive Instances): Resistance due to structural breadth (linked to K, M)
* Δ_ops define motion on the ISG:
    * Δ_gen: Adds novelty → (x, y+1)
    * Δ_self: Increases reuse → (x', y+1)
    * Δ_proj: Compresses without changing (x,y); reduces underlying cost (K, E, etc.)
* ISG ≠ the full universe: It's a projection. Full dynamics live in the cost space (K, C₂, F_β)

Space and Time (IC definition)
* Space = Compression resistance: How far a distinction is from being absorbable into current memory (measured by Δ cost).
* Time = Update history: The sequence of Δ_self transformations the observer uses to stabilize and re-encode its memory.

Noise and Δ_gen
* Δ_gen arises from noise due to unresolved microstructure interacting with finite barriers (ΔE).
* Noise = forced registration of a new, uncompressible distinction → Δ_gen
* Thermo link: Landauer cost (kBTln2) ensures any fluctuation must be heat-balanced, leading to Arrhenius-like rates and fluctuation-dissipation structure.

Bottom line:
The ISG tracks compression resistance. Space and time emerge as patterns in cost and update behavior. Δ_gen is not assumed — it's thermodynamically forced by noise interacting with bounded resolution.
