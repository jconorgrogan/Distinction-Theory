# Informational Constructivism

## Preamble: Theories of everything and the Primacy of Information and Contrast

Confronting the inherent uncertainties in our scientific knowledge, which is built upon layers of potentially imperfect assumptions, interpretations, trust in complex experiments, and the very human chains transmitting that information, demands a cautious strategy for fundamental theory building. To establish a robust foundation, particularly for a Theory of Everything, we must seek the most undeniable starting point: the absolute minimum phenomenon or operational event that any coherent description of reality, regardless of its details, must necessarily incorporate. Identifying this bedrock allows us to build upwards with greater confidence, ensuring our foundations aren't inadvertently built on inherited errors. 

There are several rival blueprints for what the universe is and why it exists. Quantum mechanics, general relativity, and string theory each offer a different ontology, yet they converge on one premise: **information** sits at the root of every description. No matter how the theories differ, all agree that something is being distinguished from something else. This points towards information processing as a fundamental aspect of reality.

But can we go deeper? Where does information, or the capacity for distinction, come from in the first place? Why should there be *any* distinction at all, any structure, any state that differs from another? Why is there something rather than nothing? [Further discussion: https://github.com/jconorgrogan/Why-there-is-something-and-not-nothing]

Informational Constructivism (IC) proposes that the most primitive *operational* event necessary for any structure or process is **Registered Contrast**. This minimal axiom, **F0**, consists of two inseparable components:
*   **D0 (Distinction Event):** Something is distinguishable from something else (a potential difference exists).
*   **R0 (Registration):** Some subsystem registers this distinction as a state change (an echo, a memory bit flip, however minimal).

Without D0, there is no difference to register. Without R0, any potential distinction has no informational consequence, leaves no trace, and cannot participate in any causal or computational process. F0 = D0 + R0 is thus the minimal requirement for "something happening" in an informational sense. As such, any theories of everything need to account for this. 

[From a phenomenological perspective, within sufficiently complex systems like evolved observers, the ongoing processing of such fundamental registered contrasts may correspond to the basic subjective experience of **feeling** or **presence** – the raw fact that *something* is being experienced, distinct from nothingness. This provides an experiential anchor, but the operational F0=D0+R0 is the formal starting point.]

Even a single F0 event implies latent "texture". This isn't an extra assumption, but a consequence of information theory: the set of possible simpler descriptions (programs) that could account for even one registered bit ({p: U(p)=x}) has unbounded complexity [See Box 0b / TODO: Formal lemma: Kolmogorov structure function / Levin's coding theorem application]. This potential complexity exists in the universal prior, providing a reservoir that later compression stages can exploit.
From F0 alone, complemented by the unavoidable constraints of Finite Capacity (C) and a Stability requirement (S) for registrations to persist causally, a surprising chain of consequences follows via information compression under resource constraints (the SUR dynamic, detailed below). C arises fundamentally from the thermodynamic cost of irreversible registration (Landauer's principle implies finite energy cost ≥ kT ln 2 per bit, hence finite capacity if energy is finite), while S ensures that registered states last long enough to participate in processes. The rough narrative goes as follows:
A single difference exists and is registered (F0) under constraints (C, S)
If a single physical difference comes into existence and is registered (F0), then a physical trace is required (by R0 and S).
If a trace exists, then at least two distinguishable system states are required (the registered state and its complement, implied by D0).
If two states can be compared (requiring persistence S), then a minimal memory register is required.
If memory exists, then change becomes detectable.
If change is detectable, then statistical regularities become exploitable.
If regularities are exploited, then compression is required (forced by capacity limit C).
If compression operates under finite resources (inherent in C), then freed capacity permits additional structure to accumulate without overflow.
If compressed patterns remain stable (due to S), then prediction algorithms become possible (driven by SUR dynamic's bias to short codes).
If prediction is possible, then an internal/external partition is required (Information Bottleneck under C).
If a partition exists, then irrelevant fluctuations must be suppressed.
If noise is suppressed, then branch pruning (hypothesis elimination) is required.
If multiple systems communicate under bandwidth limits (a consequence of C), then a shared codebook is required.
If a shared codebook stabilizes, then redundant parameters become measurable and must be removed.
If redundancy is removed, then efficiency approaches an optimum where marginal accuracy gain equals marginal resource cost (SUR optimization).
If the system sits on that optimum, then resource gradients define stable pathways for energy and information flow (emergence of physics).
Let's say that you disagree with my very premise. "Why are you just asserting that information and distinction arises?" Fair. But consider the negation: Everything I started from is wrong; you do not permit me any axioms, and we therefore assume F0 is false – a uniform void (S₀) with absolutely no distinction (T25). Let's follow that chain of logic. Suppose you have only perfect void — a state with no differences, no structure, no information.
→ Then no system exists that can recognize or respond to anything.
→ So nothing maintains internal stability or updates itself over time.
→ So there are no models, no representations of anything.
→ So comparisons — between internal expectations and external input — become impossible.
→ So nothing stands out as important or relevant.
→ So no simplification or learning can occur.
→ So memory fills with undifferentiated signals or noise.
→ So limits on capacity are quickly overwhelmed.
→ So the system loses the ability to predict or make sense of inputs.
→ So it can no longer tell if anything has changed — time and causality dissolve.
→ So it can’t separate itself from its surroundings.
→ So it can’t discard irrelevant possibilities — confusion multiplies.
→ So it can’t coordinate with anything else — shared meaning breaks down.
→ So it can’t eliminate redundancies — unnecessary complexity piles up.
→ So it loses its internal balance — resources drift and overload.
→ So any stable structure collapses — patterns, geometry, and energy all dissolve.
→ So it returns to the same undifferentiated void it started from…
This return to the void, however, highlights a fundamental inconsistency. Consider the initial premise: asserting that F0 is false (let's denote this proposition ¬P, where P := "F0 occurs"), meaning no registered contrast exists. Logic requires either P or ¬P to be true.
If P is true, then F0 is admitted.
If ¬P is true, then to evaluate this claim—to establish its truth value within any descriptive framework—requires distinguishing '¬P is true' from 'P is true'. This very act of distinction and assignment (mapping ¬P to 'true' and P to 'false', for instance) is itself an instance of registered contrast, an F0 event occurring within the framework evaluating the claim.
Therefore, denying F0 necessitates invoking F0. Both branches (assuming P or assuming ¬P) lead to the conclusion that F0 occurs. Registered contrast is thus obligatory for any non-trivial, self-consistent descriptive scheme; it cannot be coherently negated. It stands as the minimum necessary starting point.

## Building a logic tree: The Genesis
Let's take this slow. As formalized below (Box 0), the very act of representing or processing this "void" state within *any* system capable of holding state requires introducing a minimal contrast (via the `Δ_gen` operator), making the void inherently unstable from an internal perspective.

**(Box 0: Pre-distinction state and the Genesis lemma)**
> **Definition S₀**
> The pre-distinction state S₀ is the unique configuration satisfying ∀x,y ∈ S₀ : x ≡ y (maximal symmetry).
>
> **Genesis lemma**
> Let `Δ_gen` be any operation violating the S₀ equivalence. Then `Δ_gen`(S₀) = S₁ ≠ S₀, and S₁ contains contrast.
> *Proof sketch:* Based on non-equivalence. Uses classical logic. [Note: Removing Law of Excluded Middle impacts decidability, relevant if considering non-classical internal logics.]

Therefore, IC develops two converging paths driven by the same underlying logic of **Simplicity under Resource-constraint (SUR)**:
1.  **The Generative Path:** Starting from F0, SUR builds complexity and structure.
2.  **The Collapse Path:** Starting from the hypothetical void (T25/S₀), instability forces the emergence of F0, initiating the generative path.

The framework below formalizes this self-consistent loop, where contrast necessitates structure, and the absence of contrast is representationally unstable.

## The Engine: Δ-Operators and SUR Dynamics 

How does a system build structure from that initial spark of Registered Contrast (F0), or escape the instability of the void (S₀)? IC posits that this happens through fundamental **information processing operations** governed by an equally fundamental drive towards **efficiency under resource limitation**. This combination acts as the engine driving the emergence of complexity.

At the heart of this engine are three core operations, the **Δ-operators**. They represent the minimal ways an information-processing system can interact with distinctions: creating them (`Δ_gen`), stabilizing and compressing them (`Δ_proj`), and updating its own internal model or memory (`Δ_self`).

**(Box 1: The three Δ-operators and their algebra)**
> | Operator  | Type signature        | Conceptual Role & Laws                                                                       |
> | :-------- | :-------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
> | `Δ_gen`   | State → State         | **Genesis:** Introduces raw, novel contrast. Not idempotent.                                  |
> | `Δ_proj`  | (State, Constraint) → State | **Projection/Compression:** Stabilizes distinctions, finds efficient representations under constraints C. Idempotent. |
> | `Δ_self`  | (Code, Memory) → Code   | **Self-Reference/Update:** Modifies the system's internal code/memory. Enables learning, recursion. May diverge; has unique fixed point Y (Y=fix f(f)) if halts. |
>
> **Interaction & Basis:** These operators interact (e.g., `Δ_proj` stabilizes `Δ_gen`'s output) and form a complete basis. The **Factorisation Theorem (Proof Pack Step 1)** proves that any well-behaved, finite sequence of distinction-processing steps can be uniquely expressed as a combination of these three, confirming their fundamental nature.

But processing information isn't free. Any real system faces **Resource Constraints**. IC models these limits via a "ledger" C, tracking available memory, code complexity, processing time, and precision. Structure can only emerge within the boundaries set by the current ledger.

**(Refined IC Lattice: Resource Constraints)**
> The set of reachable states and structures L_{M,K,τ,ε} is defined by the ledger **C = (M, K, τ, ε)**:
> *   **M:** Memory (state storage capacity).
> *   **K:** Code Complexity (model description length limit).
> *   **τ:** Runtime (processing step limit).
> *   **ε:** Precision (error tolerance).
> This lattice quantifies the arena within which structure formation occurs.

Crucially, these constraints aren't static. Systems adapt, and the environment fluctuates. IC models the co-evolution of the system and its constraints.

**(Box 2: Constraints as a dynamical vector)**
> The ledger C(t) evolves, potentially driven by adaptive pressure against environmental noise:
> ```
> dC/dt = -∇_C L + η(t) ; ⟨η_i(t)η_j(t')⟩ = 2Dδ_ijδ(t−t')
> ```
> L is the SUR cost (below), η(t) represents noise (setting effective temperature T via D). This suggests systems shed costly resources (e.g., high K) while exploring possibilities opened by noise, constantly seeking an optimal balance under pressure.

The driving force behind adaptation and structure formation within these evolving constraints is the emergent principle of **Simplicity under Resource-constraint (SUR)**, often identifiable with Minimum Description Length (MDL). It's not a new law imposed on the system, but the inevitable outcome of local, cost-reducing decisions.

**(Emergence of MDL/SUR)**
> *   **The Problem:** A system with finite C needs to represent past distinctions (Code K) to predict future ones accurately (minimize Error E).
> *   **The Local Solution:** Any subsystem only adopts changes (e.g., model updates) if they decrease a local trade-off L = K + λE. It locally prefers simpler, more predictive models.
> *   **The Global Result:** These local, greedy optimizations inevitably converge (under technical conditions like Robbins-Monro) to a state where no further local improvement is possible – the SUR/MDL equilibrium.
> *   **The Upshot:** Reality, as processed by any constrained system, naturally organizes itself according to this efficiency principle. SUR becomes the *de facto* "law" governing information dynamics and structure building from Tier 3a onwards.

## The IC Ladder: Building Reality from Contrast

With F0 as the seed and {Δ-operators + SUR + Constraints} as the engine, the following ladder outlines the logical steps through which complexity emerges. Each tier builds upon the previous, demonstrating a path from minimal contrast to the structures of physics and observation. Key mechanisms are detailed in explanatory Boxes.

**(Box 3: Operational boundary between Mode_R and Mode_L)**
> SUR forces a distinction between potential information and actually processed information:
> *   **Mode_R (relational):** All distinctions addressable under current C.
> *   **Mode_L (logged):** The compressed, stabilized image of Mode_R stored in memory M via `Δ_proj`. Only Mode_L structures directly participate in the system's code K.

**(Box 4: Memory graph metric)**
> The history of processing leaves a trace. The observer's memory M (containing Mode_L states) implicitly forms a **directed labelled graph G=(V,E)**, where states are nodes and Δ-operations are edges. This graph defines emergent notions of:
> *   **Time (d_T):** Minimum path length between states.
> *   **Information Distance (d_I):** Minimum cumulative SUR cost (L) along a path. This metric grounds geometry.

**(Box 5: Landauer link and the λ parameter)**
> The SUR trade-off parameter λ isn't arbitrary. It's fixed by the physics of information erasure:
> λ = ∂K/∂E|_{SUR min} = **k_B T ln 2**.
> λ directly represents the minimum thermodynamic cost (heat dissipation) required to erase one bit of prediction error (E) at the effective temperature T (set by noise D in Box 2). SUR dynamics are inherently thermodynamic.

**(Box 8: Layered resolution and synthetic indistinguishability)**
> Finite observers can only process self-referential (`Δ_self`) structures up to a certain nesting depth k. Deeper complexities are effectively invisible ("synthetically indistinguishable"), projecting to simpler forms (L_k). This explains how observers with different capacities can still interact and agree on a shared, simpler-looking reality (consensus T10).

## 3. The Two Paths to Reality: A Self-Locking Loop

### 3.1 Generative Path (F0 → T24)
Registered Contrast (F0) + Salience (T1) hits Bottleneck (T2, Box 2) → Compression (T3, Box 3) via SUR (T3a) → Patterns & Memory Graph (T4, Box 4) → Observer (T4.5) → World Partition & Layering (T5, Box 8) → Time & Metric (T6) → Op. Constraints (T6a, Box 5) → Hilbert Space (T7) → Born Rule (T8) → Projection (T9) → Consensus (T10) → Curvature (T11, Box 6) → Energy Analogue (T12) → Gauge/QFT/Cosmology (T13–T23, Box 7). Result: Observers who instantiate F0 (T24), closing the loop.

### 3.2 Collapse Path (T25 → F0)
This path shows that attempting to erase structure or reach the void state (S₀/T25) forces the re‑emergence of contrast via the same SUR logic operating in reverse (optimizing *away* from featurelessness).

| From Tier | Assume structure is absent/uniform | Why state is unstable / costly under SUR | What structure is forced next (Lower Tier) |

| T1 | No Salience / Memory Ref / Multiplicity | Cannot support structured F0 | T0 F0 (Registered Contrast) |
| T0/T25 | No Contrast (S₀ / Void) | Unstable: Describing void creates contrast (Box 0) | **F0 (Registered Contrast)** |

### 3.3 Synthesis
The Generative Path (F0 → T24) builds structure from contrast via SUR.
The Collapse Path (T25 → F0) shows that eliminating contrast forces its re-emergence via SUR.
Reality operates as a self-consistent, resource-constrained informational loop (F0 ↔ T25) governed by SUR, where structure formation and the instability of featurelessness are two sides of the same coin.
### Limits of Knowledge and the Structure of Progress in IC
-------
Any theory of everything must confront an awkward fact: every scientist who
tries to test the theory is part of the very universe that the theory
describes.  The observer, the formal proof, the measuring device, and the
reasoning algorithm are not external referees; they are physical processes
subject to the same limits that govern galaxies and quarks.  A sound
framework must therefore answer two questions at the outset:

1. **Internal testability.**  Can agents *inside* the world generate
   evidence or formal demonstrations that the theory’s core claims are
   correct?

2. **Self‑stability.**  Does the theory predict its own demonstrable
   consistency, or does it condemn every inhabitant to permanent doubt about
   the framework itself?

Informational Constructivism (IC) tackles these questions by making resource
bounds explicit.  Every act of distinction, every line of proof, and every
measurement trace occupies a ledger

    L_{M,K,τ,ε} = (memory M, code K, run‑time τ, numerical precision ε).

**Crucially, IC's core engine—Simplicity under Resource-constraint (SUR)—predicts that perfect description (zero error) at infinite detail is often less optimal than a state balancing descriptive power (low error E) against complexity cost (low code K).** This implies that for any finite observer operating within a ledger C(t), a complete, simultaneous proof or description of all aspects of reality is not just impractical, but dynamically disfavored.

Consequently, IC naturally separates claims into three strata relative to the current collective ledger C(t):

*   **Locked slice.** Core tiers (roughly T₀ – T₁₂) describing the emergence of foundational structures (compression, memory, observers, operational constraints, Hilbert space, basic geometry/energy analogues). The derivations here **must** be rigorous and fit within reasonable present resources (human‐scale ledgers) for the theory to be grounded. Agents can, and must, verify this slice directly.

*   **Neutral filling.** Intermediate derivations or open problems whose current resolution status does not critically alter the core SUR cost balance or foundational structure. Proofs may arrive later as resources expand or priorities shift, but their current absence is an expected feature, not necessarily a flaw undermining the framework.

*   **Growth slice.** Conjectures and extrapolations (e.g., T₁₃+, specific constant derivations, RH connection) representing the theory's predictive frontier. These claims **must** be formulated clearly enough to be falsifiable or verifiable by future advancements that expand C(t). IC forecasts here but invites empirical or mathematical challenge. If a low-cost counter-example arises, the affected upper tier is rewritten, demonstrating adaptability while preserving the lower structure.

This architecture ensures that IC does **not** claim its own unprovability in any self‑defeating sense. Instead, it predicts a *structured and dynamic* frontier of knowledge. The locked slice provides the verifiable foundation, while the growth slice offers testable predictions. **The existence of the neutral filling and the yet-unproven aspects of the growth slice are expected consequences of the theory's own resource-limited dynamics.** Therefore, IC treats testability and structured progress as design constraints, not optional luxuries, while acknowledging the inherent limits faced by any observer embedded within the system.

## Benchmarks: what defines a good "Theory of Everything" and where is IC on this journey? (WIP)

The following table outlines ambitious benchmarks that any candidate Theory of Everything should strive towards. However, informed by the "Limits of Knowledge" discussion above, Informational Constructivism suggests that achieving all these benchmarks simultaneously is precluded by the finite resources and SUR dynamics governing any embedded observer.

Therefore, IC should be evaluated not only on its ultimate potential but also on:
1.  The rigor and completeness of its **Locked Slice** (addressing foundational benchmarks like P-A, G-A, S-A, and demonstrating pathways for P-B, P-C, G-B, G-C1, S-D, I-1 within reasonable complexity).
2.  The clarity, novelty, and falsifiability of its **Growth Slice** predictions (aiming for G-C2, S-B, S-C).
3.  The overall coherence of the framework in explaining *why* certain aspects might remain in the **Neutral Filling** or require future resource expansion for resolution.

The statuses below reflect the current state of IC relative to these demanding goals, viewed through the lens of its own resource-aware framework.

| ----------------------- | ---- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| **Foundation (P)**      | P‑A  | Write down the theory’s core rule‑set—its “source code of the universe”—in a clear, formal language that leaves no room for interpretation. | :heavy_check_mark:  |
|                         | P‑B  | Prove, with Kolmogorov‑style math, that those rules are **much shorter** than the pile of raw observations they explain—so they really do compress reality. | :construction:      |
|                         | P‑C  | Show the rule‑set is **minimal and simplest**: remove any rule and the fit breaks; add a rule and you must get a big accuracy boost to justify the extra complexity. | :construction:      |
|                         | P‑D  | Give a convincing argument (logical or physical) for why *this* exact rule‑set has to exist instead of nothing or some totally different set. | :warning:           |
| **Generative power (E & Π)** | G‑A  | Define a function that turns any real‑world observation into the theory’s internal “state” while still keeping important differences separate. | :heavy_check_mark:  |
|                         | G‑B  | Define the engine that takes a current state and a time‑step and spits out probabilities for future states, with clear error bars. | :construction:      |
|                         | G‑C1 | Show that running that engine reproduces general relativity, quantum mechanics, the Standard Model, and cosmology—at least qualitatively. | :construction:      |
|                         | G‑C2 | Go further: derive (or tightly bound) the actual numbers—particle masses, α≈1/137, dark‑energy Λ, etc.—without hand‑tuning. | :white_large_square: |
| **Scope & adaptability (B & M)** | S‑A  | Spell out a boundary test that says when an observation is **inside** the theory’s domain of validity and when it isn’t. | :heavy_check_mark:  |
|                         | S‑B  | Within that domain, explain any “mystery constants” and clean up known paradoxes without patch‑jobs. | :construction:      |
|                         | S‑C  | Put at least one bold, near‑term, make‑or‑break prediction on the table so experiments can kill or confirm the theory. | :construction:      |
|                         | S‑D  | Provide an explicit update rule that tells us how the theory rewrites itself when new data arrive—while cutting complexity, boosting accuracy, or widening scope. | :construction:      |
| **Multi‑level compression (human limits)** | C‑A  | Show the core theory can be compressed into a form that a trained scientific community can genuinely understand (it fits in human working memory). | :white_large_square: |
|                         | C‑B  | Show that understood form can be further compressed into ordinary language / math so researchers can share, debate, and teach it. | :construction:      |
| **Internal consistency** | I‑1  | Prove there are no logical contradictions or non‑computable steps lurking anywhere in the full framework (rules, mapping, predictions, boundaries, updates). | :construction:      |
