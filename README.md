# Informational Constructivism

## Preamble: The Primacy of Information and Contrast

There are several rival blueprints for what the universe is and why it exists. Quantum mechanics, general relativity, and string theory each offer a different ontology, yet they converge on one premise: **information** sits at the root of every description. No matter how the theories differ, all agree that something is being distinguished from something else. This points towards information processing as a fundamental aspect of reality.

But can we go deeper? Where does information, or the capacity for distinction, come from in the first place? Why should there be *any* distinction at all, any structure, any state that differs from another? Why is there something rather than nothing? [Further discussion: https://github.com/jconorgrogan/Why-there-is-something-and-not-nothing]

Informational Constructivism (IC) proposes that the most primitive *operational* event necessary for any structure or process is **Registered Contrast**. This minimal axiom, **F0**, consists of two inseparable components:
*   **D0 (Distinction Event):** Something is distinguishable from something else (a potential difference exists).
*   **R0 (Registration):** Some subsystem registers this distinction as a state change (an echo, a memory bit flip, however minimal).

Without D0, there is no difference to register. Without R0, any potential distinction has no informational consequence, leaves no trace, and cannot participate in any causal or computational process. F0 = D0 + R0 is thus the minimal requirement for "something happening" in an informational sense.

[From a phenomenological perspective, within sufficiently complex systems like evolved observers, the ongoing processing of such fundamental registered contrasts may correspond to the basic subjective experience of **feeling** or **presence** – the raw fact that *something* is being experienced, distinct from nothingness. This provides an experiential anchor, but the operational F0=D0+R0 is the formal starting point.]

Even a single F0 event implies latent "texture". This isn't an extra assumption, but a consequence of information theory: the set of possible simpler descriptions (programs) that could account for even one registered bit (`{p: U(p)=x}`) has unbounded complexity [See **Box 0b / TODO:** Formal lemma: Kolmogorov structure function / Levin's coding theorem application]. This potential complexity exists in the universal prior, providing a reservoir that later compression stages can exploit.

From F0 alone, a surprising chain of consequences follows via information compression under resource constraints (the SUR dynamic, detailed below): Registered contrast (F0) implies limitation (T2), limitation forces compression (T3), compression yields memory, prediction, time, identity, and eventually the structured physical world we observe (T4-T24).

Alternatively, consider the negation: Everything I started from is wrong; you do not permit me any axioms, and we therefore assume F0 is false – a uniform void (S₀) with absolutely no distinction (T25). Well, as we will see:
Suppose you start with a perfect void — a state with no differences, no structure, no information.

→ Then no system exists that can recognize or respond to anything.
→ So nothing maintains internal stability or updates itself over time.
→ So there are no models, no representations of anything.
→ So comparisons — between internal expectations and external input — become impossible.
→ So nothing stands out as important or relevant.
→ So no simplification or learning can occur.
→ So memory fills with undifferentiated signals or noise.
→ So limits on capacity are quickly overwhelmed.
→ So the system loses the ability to predict or make sense of inputs.
→ So it can no longer tell if anything has changed — time and causality dissolve.
→ So it can’t separate itself from its surroundings.
→ So it can’t discard irrelevant possibilities — confusion multiplies.
→ So it can’t coordinate with anything else — shared meaning breaks down.
→ So it can’t eliminate redundancies — unnecessary complexity piles up.
→ So it loses its internal balance — resources drift and overload.
→ So any stable structure collapses — patterns, geometry, and energy all dissolve.
→ So it returns to the same undifferentiated void it started from…

But now that void is unstable — because even describing it, or trying to represent it, requires creating a difference.

Let's take this slow. As formalized below (Box 0), the very act of representing or processing this "void" state within *any* system capable of holding state requires introducing a minimal contrast (via the `Δ_gen` operator), making the void inherently unstable from an internal perspective.

**(Box 0: Pre-distinction state and the Genesis lemma)**
> **Definition S₀**
> The pre-distinction state S₀ is the unique configuration satisfying ∀x,y ∈ S₀ : x ≡ y (maximal symmetry).
>
> **Genesis lemma**
> Let `Δ_gen` be any operation violating the S₀ equivalence. Then `Δ_gen`(S₀) = S₁ ≠ S₀, and S₁ contains contrast.
> *Proof sketch:* Based on non-equivalence. Uses classical logic. [Note: Removing Law of Excluded Middle impacts decidability, relevant if considering non-classical internal logics.]

Therefore, IC develops two converging paths driven by the same underlying logic of **Simplicity under Resource-constraint (SUR)**:
1.  **The Generative Path:** Starting from F0, SUR builds complexity and structure.
2.  **The Collapse Path:** Starting from the hypothetical void (T25/S₀), instability forces the emergence of F0, initiating the generative path.

The framework below formalizes this self-consistent loop, where contrast necessitates structure, and the absence of contrast is representationally unstable.

## The Engine: Δ-Operators and SUR Dynamics 

How does a system build structure from that initial spark of Registered Contrast (F0), or escape the instability of the void (S₀)? IC posits that this happens through fundamental **information processing operations** governed by an equally fundamental drive towards **efficiency under resource limitation**. This combination acts as the engine driving the emergence of complexity.

At the heart of this engine are three core operations, the **Δ-operators**. They represent the minimal ways an information-processing system can interact with distinctions: creating them (`Δ_gen`), stabilizing and compressing them (`Δ_proj`), and updating its own internal model or memory (`Δ_self`).

**(Box 1: The three Δ-operators and their algebra)**
> | Operator  | Type signature        | Conceptual Role & Laws                                                                       |
> | :-------- | :-------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
> | `Δ_gen`   | State → State         | **Genesis:** Introduces raw, novel contrast. Not idempotent.                                  |
> | `Δ_proj`  | (State, Constraint) → State | **Projection/Compression:** Stabilizes distinctions, finds efficient representations under constraints C. Idempotent. |
> | `Δ_self`  | (Code, Memory) → Code   | **Self-Reference/Update:** Modifies the system's internal code/memory. Enables learning, recursion. May diverge; has unique fixed point Y (Y=fix f(f)) if halts. |
>
> **Interaction & Basis:** These operators interact (e.g., `Δ_proj` stabilizes `Δ_gen`'s output) and form a complete basis. The **Factorisation Theorem (Proof Pack Step 1)** proves that any well-behaved, finite sequence of distinction-processing steps can be uniquely expressed as a combination of these three, confirming their fundamental nature.

But processing information isn't free. Any real system faces **Resource Constraints**. IC models these limits via a "ledger" C, tracking available memory, code complexity, processing time, and precision. Structure can only emerge within the boundaries set by the current ledger.

**(Refined IC Lattice: Resource Constraints)**
> The set of reachable states and structures L_{M,K,τ,ε} is defined by the ledger **C = (M, K, τ, ε)**:
> *   **M:** Memory (state storage capacity).
> *   **K:** Code Complexity (model description length limit).
> *   **τ:** Runtime (processing step limit).
> *   **ε:** Precision (error tolerance).
> This lattice quantifies the arena within which structure formation occurs.

Crucially, these constraints aren't static. Systems adapt, and the environment fluctuates. IC models the co-evolution of the system and its constraints.

**(Box 2: Constraints as a dynamical vector)**
> The ledger C(t) evolves, potentially driven by adaptive pressure against environmental noise:
> ```
> dC/dt = -∇_C L + η(t) ; ⟨η_i(t)η_j(t')⟩ = 2Dδ_ijδ(t−t')
> ```
> L is the SUR cost (below), η(t) represents noise (setting effective temperature T via D). This suggests systems shed costly resources (e.g., high K) while exploring possibilities opened by noise, constantly seeking an optimal balance under pressure.

The driving force behind adaptation and structure formation within these evolving constraints is the emergent principle of **Simplicity under Resource-constraint (SUR)**, often identifiable with Minimum Description Length (MDL). It's not a new law imposed on the system, but the inevitable outcome of local, cost-reducing decisions.

**(Emergence of MDL/SUR)**
> *   **The Problem:** A system with finite C needs to represent past distinctions (Code K) to predict future ones accurately (minimize Error E).
> *   **The Local Solution:** Any subsystem only adopts changes (e.g., model updates) if they decrease a local trade-off L = K + λE. It locally prefers simpler, more predictive models.
> *   **The Global Result:** These local, greedy optimizations inevitably converge (under technical conditions like Robbins-Monro) to a state where no further local improvement is possible – the SUR/MDL equilibrium.
> *   **The Upshot:** Reality, as processed by any constrained system, naturally organizes itself according to this efficiency principle. SUR becomes the *de facto* "law" governing information dynamics and structure building from Tier 3a onwards.

## The IC Ladder: Building Reality from Contrast

With F0 as the seed and {Δ-operators + SUR + Constraints} as the engine, the following ladder outlines the logical steps through which complexity emerges. Each tier builds upon the previous, demonstrating a path from minimal contrast to the structures of physics and observation. Key mechanisms are detailed in explanatory Boxes.

**(Box 3: Operational boundary between Mode_R and Mode_L)**
> SUR forces a distinction between potential information and actually processed information:
> *   **Mode_R (relational):** All distinctions addressable under current C.
> *   **Mode_L (logged):** The compressed, stabilized image of Mode_R stored in memory M via `Δ_proj`. Only Mode_L structures directly participate in the system's code K.

**(Box 4: Memory graph metric)**
> The history of processing leaves a trace. The observer's memory M (containing Mode_L states) implicitly forms a **directed labelled graph G=(V,E)**, where states are nodes and Δ-operations are edges. This graph defines emergent notions of:
> *   **Time (d_T):** Minimum path length between states.
> *   **Information Distance (d_I):** Minimum cumulative SUR cost (L) along a path. This metric grounds geometry.

**(Box 5: Landauer link and the λ parameter)**
> The SUR trade-off parameter λ isn't arbitrary. It's fixed by the physics of information erasure:
> λ = ∂K/∂E|_{SUR min} = **k_B T ln 2**.
> λ directly represents the minimum thermodynamic cost (heat dissipation) required to erase one bit of prediction error (E) at the effective temperature T (set by noise D in Box 2). SUR dynamics are inherently thermodynamic.

**(Box 8: Layered resolution and synthetic indistinguishability)**
> Finite observers can only process self-referential (`Δ_self`) structures up to a certain nesting depth k. Deeper complexities are effectively invisible ("synthetically indistinguishable"), projecting to simpler forms (L_k). This explains how observers with different capacities can still interact and agree on a shared, simpler-looking reality (consensus T10).

## 3. The Two Paths to Reality: A Self-Locking Loop

### 3.1 Generative Path (F0 → T24)
Registered Contrast (F0) + Salience (T1) hits Bottleneck (T2, Box 2) → Compression (T3, Box 3) via SUR (T3a) → Patterns & Memory Graph (T4, Box 4) → Observer (T4.5) → World Partition & Layering (T5, Box 8) → Time & Metric (T6) → Op. Constraints (T6a, Box 5) → Hilbert Space (T7) → Born Rule (T8) → Projection (T9) → Consensus (T10) → Curvature (T11, Box 6) → Energy Analogue (T12) → Gauge/QFT/Cosmology (T13–T23, Box 7). Result: Observers who instantiate F0 (T24), closing the loop.

### 3.2 Collapse Path (T25 → F0)
This path shows that attempting to erase structure or reach the void state (S₀/T25) forces the re‑emergence of contrast via the same SUR logic operating in reverse (optimizing *away* from featurelessness).

### 3.3 Synthesis
The Generative Path (F0 → T24) builds structure from contrast via SUR.
The Collapse Path (T25 → F0) shows that eliminating contrast forces its re-emergence via SUR.
Reality operates as a self-consistent, resource-constrained informational loop (F0 ↔ T25) governed by SUR, where structure formation and the instability of featurelessness are two sides of the same coin.
