# Informational Constructivism

4/28/23: I've been thinking about the problem with pure mathematics (as distinct from applied mathematics) for a while now. I'm not alone here (For instance: see N J Wildberger's recent comments https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhN4X56E7iM ) The following are speculative musings on information as the root of mathematics and our observable universe that I think might address some of the root causes and suggest a new approach; I hope to build out this theory over time. Below is a rough draft outline. 


### Introduction

#### 1.1 The Limitations of Current Mathematical Foundations

Mathematics, as currently understood, rests on a foundation established primarily by set theory. This system, developed between the late 19th and early 20th centuries, offers a rigorous framework for defining mathematical objects and deducing theorems. Despite the substantial capabilities of set theory, it faces several inherent limitations. Firstly, set theory is based on axioms, such as the axiom of choice, which have sparked considerable debate. These axioms serve as arbitrary starting points; varying these axioms can lead to different mathematical outcomes. Secondly, as Gödel's incompleteness theorems reveal, any sufficiently complex axiomatic system, including set theory, contains true but unprovable statements within its structure, highlighting fundamental limitations to what mathematics can prove. Lastly, set theory’s reliance on abstract, infinite collections distances it from practical applications in the physical sciences and computation, creating a conceptual divide.

#### 1.2 The Potential of an Information-Theoretic Approach

Considering these constraints, we advocate for a novel foundational approach based on information theory, rather than sets. Originating from the work of Claude Shannon in the mid-20th century, information theory provides a robust framework for quantifying and analyzing information properties. By prioritizing information as the fundamental element, our approach seeks to align mathematics more closely with computation and the physical sciences, addressing several of set theory's limitations. We view mathematical objects and structures as patterns of information, with mathematical operations and proofs functioning as processes of information transformation and transmission. This perspective aims to deliver a more integrated and accessible understanding of mathematics, as well as unintuitive concepts such as infinity.

#### 1.3 Goals and Structure of the Paper

This paper aims to outline a framework for an information-theoretic foundation of mathematics. We will begin by defining the concept of information, exploring its essential properties and operations. Subsequently, we will reinterpret fundamental mathematical concepts such as numbers, functions, and spaces through an informational lens. We will examine how this approach can address some of the paradoxes and constraints of set theory. Then we will look into how this approach could apply to our observable universe and close with some ideas for future avenues for research.
