# How Could a Universe Be *Logically* Inevitable?
*A strictly minimal-assumption derivation*

---

## TLDR

****Concrete Difference is Logically Necessary:** **Any possible reality or system cannot coherently be pure nothingness (it's empty and unchangeable) nor pure everything-at-once (it's a static, unusable paradox). This logical impossibility of the extremes forces the emergence of at least one specific, finite distinction ('this' vs 'not this') – the minimum requirement for any structure or information to exist.
**Repetition is Inevitable given the neccesity:** Any system with limited options (a finite number of ways to be) that keeps changing must eventually repeat its states. Recognizing "this happened again" is the simplest form of internal time and memory.
**Efficiency forces complex structure:** For a system with limited resources (like memory space or energy for changes) to keep operating as things get complicated, it's forced to become efficient. It must reuse patterns or encode information cleverly to avoid 'running out of room' or crashing. This necessary drive for efficiency automatically builds internal structure, rules, and complexity.

## Stage 1: Forced Finite Distinction from Ontological Limits

0.  **Consider Ontological Extremes:** Instead of starting within a pre-defined framework, consider the absolute conceptual limits:
    *   **S₀ (Absolute Null):** Pure non-being, lacking any states or distinctions.
    *   **Ω (Absolute Plenitude):** The simultaneous actualization of all possible distinctions.
1.  **Incoherence of Extremes:**
    *   S₀ is sterile: It cannot support internal reference or structure. Attempting to reference it (requiring **Assumption L0: Propositional discourse is possible**) instantly creates a distinction (S₀ vs. Not-S₀) *outside* of S₀ itself, demonstrating its instability under reference.
    *   Ω is incoherent/unstable: Simultaneous actualization prevents selection, change, or stable reference. It collapses under logical contradiction (containing A and ¬A simultaneously for all A) and violates the finite constraints (like S-FiniteQ, justified below) needed for operational persistence or computation.
2.  **The Forced Interface (P-0 & P-1 Emergence):** Since neither S₀ nor Ω alone provides a coherent basis for a persistent, structured reality, any such reality must exist "between" these extremes or arise from their interaction. The very conceptualization of both S₀ and Ω forces consideration of their boundary or **interface**. This interface is unique:
    *   It inherently possesses **latent multiplicity (P-0):** The fundamental distinction between the S₀ regime and the Ω regime (or simply the distinction S₀ vs. Not-S₀ forced by L0) provides the necessary ≥ 2 potential configurations.
    *   It necessarily provides **enablement (P-1):** The interface between total absence and total presence is definitionally unstable and fluctuation-prone (possessing intrinsic logical/ontological "noise"). This instability creates a "writable slot" – a degree of freedom that *must* resolve towards one side or the other, susceptible to infinitesimal symmetry-breaking "pushes".
3.  **The First Forced Distinction (F-0):** The necessary coexistence of latent multiplicity (P-0) and enablement (P-1) at the S₀/Ω interface *forces* a distinction to be registered. The instability cannot remain perpetually unresolved; a selection must occur. This first event, **F-0 (Registered Contrast)**, is the "seed bit" of actuality, the first concrete information.
4.  **Inherent Finiteness (Basis for S-FiniteQ):** This first distinction F-0, arising at a threshold/boundary between fundamentally different regimes (Null vs. Not-Null), is inherently *finite*. It represents a discrete selection (e.g., resolving into the "Not-S₀" category) rather than selecting one point from a perfect continuum. Infinite precision is incompatible with the instability and threshold nature of the S₀/Ω boundary. This provides the ontological grounding for **Property S-FiniteQ (Finite Distinguishability)**, which becomes crucial for operational dynamics in Stage 2.
5.  **Potential for Temporal Significance (Setting stage for L1):** For F-0 to be more than an instantaneous flash and serve as a basis for memory or sequence, distinctions must be able to persist or recur *if the system evolves dynamically*. This condition, **L1 (Persistence/Recurrence)**, allows the system to differentiate "first occurrence" from "again," seeding internal order (time). Stage 1 establishes the forced finite nature of distinction (F0/S-FiniteQ); Stage 2 will show how dynamics within this finite space necessarily lead to recurrence (realizing L1).
6.  **Pass to Stage 2:** We now analyze the consequences for systems built upon this foundation: a forced, finite distinction (F-0 grounded in the S₀/Ω interface, implying S-FiniteQ) whose potential for recurrence (L1) we will explore. Stage 1 establishes *that* a finite distinction *must* arise; Stage 2 explores *how* it evolves dynamically when embodied in a carrier medium, proving that recurrence is inevitable.

---

## Stage 2: Emergence of Structured Dynamics (Requires S-Assumptions)

**Preamble:** We now consider systems founded on the forced, finite distinction (F-0 arising from the S₀/Ω interface, implying S-FiniteQ) that *also* possess properties enabling **dynamic evolution, internal stability, and information processing under resource constraints.** This necessitates further assumptions related to the nature of the medium supporting persistence and change:

1.  **Finite split exists** (F-0 met, S-FiniteQ implied) → implies the existence of ≥ 2 distinguishable states or classes within the system.
2.  **Carrier Necessity (**Assumption S-Carrier: References are instantiated in a medium whose state can change yet remain identifiable**):** Dynamics (change over time) require a **stable medium (carrier)**. This medium provides the causal link between states, enabling evolution beyond static patterns.
3.  **Explosion-free Evolution**: A stable carrier (S-Carrier) inherently prevents the simultaneous actualization of all its possible states (respecting the exclusion implied by leaving Ω), thereby enabling ordered transitions and evolution.
4.  **Finite Distinguishability (**Implied Property S-FiniteQ**: The carrier operates on a finite quotient of distinguishable classes**):** As established in Stage 1, the foundational distinction (F0) is inherently finite. For stable operation within any physical carrier (S-Carrier), differences must be resolved only up to a certain threshold (overcoming noise), yielding a finite set of operational equivalence classes, |Σ| = m < ∞. This remains a crucial operational constraint for any realizable system.
5.  **Memory Bound**: Finite distinguishability (S-FiniteQ) immediately implies a finite information capacity for representing the system's base state, requiring approximately ⌈log₂ m⌉ bits per distinct state selection.
6.  **Recurrence is Mathematically Forced (Realizing L1):** Given a finite number of states (`m` from S-FiniteQ) and dynamics enabling transitions between them (S-Carrier), any sufficiently long trajectory *must* eventually revisit a previously occupied state (or sequence of states). This inevitable recurrence, guaranteed by the Pigeonhole Principle (combinatorially) or Poincaré recurrence theorems (dynamically, even for stochastic/dissipative systems within their finite reachable state graph), fulfills the condition **L1 (Persistence/Recurrence)**. It is not an extra assumption, but a mathematical consequence of finite dynamics. This recurrence allows the system to internally recognize patterns again, forming the basis for stable references, memory, and cycles.
7.  **Successor Mapping ⇒ Proto-Time**: The ability to transition between states (S-Carrier) and the occurrence of recurrence (L1 realized) allows counting steps between identifiable events, defining an operational, ordered sequence isomorphic to segments of the natural numbers (ℕ). This establishes an internal measure of time based on state changes.
8.  **Irreversible-Update Cost (**Assumption S-Cost: Erasing a distinguishable class or transitioning requires a positive resource debit**):** In any stable (S-Carrier) finite system (S-FiniteQ), resetting a state or executing a transition (discarding alternatives) cannot be achieved without expending some resource (≥ *c* > 0), due to logical irreversibility (information erasure) or the need to overcome noise/potential ambiguity in the carrier. This reflects thermodynamic or quantum costs in physical systems.
9.  **Saturation (L5) and Forced Structure (SUR)**: The system's internal dynamics (S-Carrier) can generate configurations whose effective informational complexity demands more distinctions than available base states (`m` from S-FiniteQ). Let `I_t` represent the *theoretical minimum number* of distinct base states (`m`) required to unambiguously label the system's operationally distinguishable configuration or history segment at step `t`. (This `I_t` is a cardinality bound derived from the dynamics and state space; the system itself need not compute it). For sufficiently rich dynamics, states where `I_t > m` are inevitable. This is the **Saturation Condition (L5)**. When L5 occurs, systems that persist (i.e., satisfy Condition C2 by avoiding incoherent halt states `Φ_halt`) *must* resolve it using mechanisms compatible with S-FiniteQ and S-Cost. The admissible mechanisms are:
    *   **State reuse (Φ_overwrite):** Maps the complex state to an existing class `sᵢ`, losing prior information associated with `sᵢ` and incurring cost `c`.
    *   **Patterned encoding (Φ_encode):** Uses sequences or patterns of states (`Σ^k`, k>1) to represent the complex state, preserving more information but incurring higher costs (`k*c` plus descriptive overhead K for the encoding scheme).
10. **The SUR Dynamic**: The necessity for persistent systems (satisfying C2) of resolving L5 via Φ_overwrite or Φ_encode under resource constraints (S-Cost) within a finite system (S-FiniteQ) defines the **SUR dynamic**. SUR is not an optimization *goal*, but the resulting set of trajectories that remain operationally viable by implicitly managing the trade-off between information fidelity (description complexity K) and resource expenditure (operational cost E). This dynamic inherently favors configurations amenable to efficient representation and processing (minimizing a joint cost like `K + λE`), driving the emergence of **logic, computation, compression, error correction, and hierarchical structures**. Apparent continua in observed physics can arise as idealized limits (m → ∞, resolution → 0) of these underlying finite, discrete processes governed by SUR.

---

## Conclusion

> The moment the unavoidable interface between Nothingness (S₀) and Everythingness (Ω) forces a finite distinction (F0, implying S-FiniteQ), and dynamics within a **stable medium (**S-Carrier**) inevitably cause that distinction or its consequences to appear *again* (L1 realized), absolute nothingness is operationally transcended by a system capable of internal time and memory. *If* this system pays **non-zero update costs (**S-Cost**), it necessarily confronts internal representational limits (**L5**). The requirement for persistent operation (Condition C2) under these constraints forces the system into trajectories (the **SUR dynamic**) that resolve these limits through state reuse or patterned encoding. This dynamic inevitably structures the system's behavior, favoring efficiency and leading to the emergence of logic, computation, and the hierarchical complexification characteristic of physically instantiated universes. Demonstrating the precise mapping from the SUR dynamic to specific observed physical laws (e.g., gauge fields, locality) via mechanisms like emergent error correction remains a task for further investigation, but the present derivation establishes the logical inevitability of SUR itself as the governing principle for this class of systems.

### Invitation to Reviewers

> Does the derivation of the initial finite distinction (F0) and the basis for finite distinguishability (S-FiniteQ) from the S₀/Ω interface (Stage 1) seem logically sound and reduce the axiomatic burden? Is the subsequent derivation of recurrence (L1) from finite dynamics (Stage 2) convincing? Are the requirements for dynamics (S-Carrier, S-Cost) and the persistence condition (C2) adequately justified for the target class of *persistent, dynamic, stable, observable* systems this derivation aims to model? Feedback is welcomed on logical soundness, assumption transparency, and conceptual economy.

# Technical Appendix A — Extended Deduction

## The Core Logic: From Ontological Limits to Necessary Structure

**The Foundational Question:** Setting aside initial presuppositions about reality, observers, or specific physical laws, what can be deduced about the fundamental structure of *any* potential reality based on the sheer possibility of reference or distinction?

### Section 1: Ontological Limits (S₀ and Ω)

We begin by considering the absolute conceptual boundaries of existence:

*   **S₀ (Absolute Null):** Defined as pure non-being, devoid of any states, properties, substrate, or distinctions.
    *   *Analysis:* While conceptually possible to name, S₀ is inherently sterile. It lacks the multiplicity needed for information or structure. Furthermore, it is unstable under **Assumption L0 (Possibility of Propositional Discourse)**: attempting to reference or consider S₀ forces a distinction (S₀ vs. Not-S₀) *within the referencing framework*, demonstrating that the framework itself cannot be S₀.
*   **Ω (Absolute Plenitude):** Defined as the simultaneous actualization of all conceivable distinctions, states, and properties.
    *   *Analysis:* Ω is structurally incoherent and operationally unusable.
        *   *Contradiction:* It inherently contains contradictions (e.g., Property P and Property ¬P exist simultaneously).
        *   *No Selection/Change:* If everything exists at once, no specific state can be selected, recorded, or changed into another. This precludes dynamics, computation, and persistence of specific patterns.
        *   *Infinite Resource Demand:* Requires infinite capacity and perfect precision to instantiate infinitely many distinctions, violating the finiteness constraints (S-FiniteQ, justified below) necessary for stable, operational systems.

Conclusion for Section 1: Neither pure Null nor total Plenitude provides a viable foundation for a reality exhibiting structure, persistence, or dynamics.

### Section 2: The Necessary Interface

Since S₀ and Ω are untenable extremes, any coherent, structured reality must exist "between" them or arise from their interaction. The crucial step is recognizing that the very act of considering both S₀ and Ω forces us to consider their relationship, their boundary, or their **interface**. This interface isn't just a spatial boundary but a logical or ontological transition zone.

### Section 3: Emergence of P-0 and P-1 from the Interface

The S₀/Ω interface possesses unique properties forced by the nature of the extremes it separates:

*   **P-0 (Latent Multiplicity) Emerges:** The interface intrinsically embodies distinction. At minimum, the distinction between the regime governed by S₀-like properties (absence) and the regime governed by Ω-like properties (presence/plenitude) exists. Even simpler, the distinction S₀ vs. Not-S₀, forced by L0, provides the necessary ≥ 2 potential configurations. The interface is the locus where this difference is manifest.
*   **P-1 (Enablement) Emerges:** The interface represents a zone of maximum ontological tension – the boundary between absolute absence and absolute presence. This tension makes the interface inherently unstable and fluctuation-prone. It cannot stably be *purely* S₀ or *purely* Ω. This instability acts as:
    *   *A Writable Slot:* A degree of freedom exists at the boundary that is not fixed, capable of resolving towards one side or the other (e.g., locally manifesting a distinction or failing to).
    *   *Non-Zero Noise:* The fundamental incompatibility and tension provide an intrinsic source of logical/ontological "noise" or fluctuation, constantly perturbing the state at the interface.

Conclusion for Section 3: The S₀/Ω interface necessarily embodies the conditions P-0 (potential for difference) and P-1 (a writable, noisy slot) required for a distinction to become actual.

### Section 4: Forced Finite Distinction (F-0) and Grounding S-FiniteQ

The inevitable consequence of having P-0 and P-1 coexist at the interface is:

*   **F-0 (Registered Contrast) is Forced:** The unstable P-1 condition acting on the potential difference P-0 *must* resolve. A specific distinction will inevitably be actualized or registered as the system locally "chooses" a state (e.g., Not-S₀). This symmetry breaking is the first informational event, F-0.
*   **F-0 is Inherently Finite (Grounds S-FiniteQ):** The distinction arising at this boundary is not one choice among an infinite continuum of perfectly precise states. It's a threshold effect – crossing the boundary from "effectively Null" to "manifesting a distinction." Registering this requires overcoming the inherent noise/instability (P-1). Any realizable registration mechanism (physical or logical) has finite resolution and noise floor. Differences below this threshold are operationally indistinguishable. Therefore, the first registered distinction F-0 corresponds to selecting one from a *finite* set of operationally distinct outcomes. This provides the fundamental basis for **Property S-FiniteQ (Finite Distinguishability)**: the idea that any operational system arising from this foundation will necessarily operate on a finite set of distinguishable states or equivalence classes.

Conclusion for Section 4: The S₀/Ω interface doesn't just allow distinction; it *forces* a *finite* distinction (F-0) into existence, providing the seed for S-FiniteQ.

### Section 5: Realization of Recurrence (L1) via Finite Dynamics

The forced finite distinction (F0) and the resulting finite state space (S-FiniteQ established in Sec 4) provide the *potential* for structure. However, for this structure to accumulate or for concepts like memory to arise, distinctions must be re-identifiable. This is condition **L1 (Persistence/Recurrence)**.

L1 is not an additional fundamental assumption about stability. Instead, it emerges necessarily once dynamics are introduced:

*   **Premise 1:** The system has a finite number of operational states (`m`, from S-FiniteQ).
*   **Premise 2:** The system undergoes state transitions over time (requires S-Carrier, discussed in Sec 8).
*   **Conclusion (L1 Realized):** Any trajectory evolving long enough within a finite state space must eventually revisit states (Pigeonhole Principle / Poincaré Recurrence). This holds even for stochastic or dissipative dynamics within their finite reachable state graph, although the recurrence times may vary.

Thus, L1 – the ability to recognize a distinction again – is a guaranteed feature of any *persistent, dynamic, finite system* like the one derived here. It underpins the possibility of cycles, stable references, and memory, which are crucial for the subsequent emergence of complex computation and structure (SUR).

### Section 6: Transition to Dynamics and Structure

The foundation established so far (F-0 arising from S₀/Ω, implying S-FiniteQ, with L1 guaranteed once dynamics occur) is necessary but potentially static. To get a dynamic, evolving universe, we need mechanisms for change and interaction within a medium:

*   **Requirement for S-Carrier:** A substrate is needed to *host* these distinctions and allow transitions between them.
*   **Requirement for S-Cost:** Realized transitions in finite systems have associated costs (logical or physical).

These lead into the analysis of Stage 2 (main text) and the subsequent derivation of the SUR dynamic based on resolving saturation under cost constraints.

*(The following sections correspond roughly to the original Appendix A, Parts 2-5, now building on the S₀/Ω foundation and derived L1)*

### Section 7: Necessary Static Consequences of F0 + S-FiniteQ

If a system has a registered, finite distinction, what static structure is implied even before considering full dynamics and recurrence? Let Σ be the set of minimal, operationally distinguishable internal classes.

*   **(Lemma S1) `m ≥ 2`:** F0 (a registered contrast) implies at least two distinguishable situations/classes (the registered state vs. at least one alternative). `|Σ| = m ≥ 2`.
*   **(Lemma S2) `m < ∞`:** This is directly from **Property S-FiniteQ**, grounded in Section 4.
*   **(Lemma S3) Labelling & Info Content:** Finite, distinguishable classes (S1, S2) allow labelling. Specifying 1 of `m` requires ~`log₂(m)` bits capacity.
*   **(Lemma S4) Primitive Negation/Partition:** `m ≥ 2` allows partitioning Σ into `{sᵢ}` vs. `Σ \ {sᵢ}` ('not `sᵢ`'), enabling basic logical operations.

End of Static Truths: A discrete, finite, non-singular quotient set capable of partitioning is structurally unavoidable *before* L1 is explicitly realized via dynamics.

### Section 8: Logically Allowed Behaviors (Introducing S-Carrier)

Static structure (S1-S4) defines *what* the system is. Behavior (dynamics) requires transitions, necessitating **Assumption S-Carrier (Stable Medium for Change)**. Let `D` represent the dynamics `D: Σ → Σ` (or `D: Σ^k → Σ`).

*   **Possibility Axis 1: Change vs. Stasis**
    *   *With S-Carrier (non-trivial D):* Transitions `sᵢ → sⱼ` are possible. System is **Dynamic**. Dynamics acting on the finite state space (S-FiniteQ) *will* lead to recurrence (L1).
    *   *Without S-Carrier (or trivial D):* System remains **Static**. L1 is never realized.
*   **Possibility Axis 2: Internal Connectivity (if Dynamic)**
    *   *Dynamic, Limited Reachability:* `D` induces a state graph that is not fully connected. Recurrence happens within connected components.
    *   *Dynamic, Full Reachability:* `D` induces a connected state graph. Recurrence applies globally.

Conclusion for Section 8: S-Carrier enables dynamics upon the static finite structure, which in turn guarantees recurrence (L1).

### Section 9: Saturation Condition (Consequence of Dynamics + Finiteness)

Can dynamic systems (requiring F0, S-FiniteQ, S-Carrier, thus realizing L1) generate configurations requiring more representational distinction than their base `m` states?

*   **Internal Complexity Potential:** Dynamics `D` *can* generate configurations or histories whose unique identification demands more than `m` distinct labels.
*   **Defining Informational Load `I_t`:** The theoretical minimum cardinality of Σ-classes needed to unambiguously represent the system's distinguishable configuration/history at step `t`.
*   **Deducing Saturation Condition (L5):**
    *   *Premise 1:* System is dynamic (has S-Carrier) and thus exhibits recurrence (L1).
    *   *Premise 2:* System has finite classes (S-FiniteQ, `m < ∞`).
    *   *Premise 3:* Dynamics `D` are sufficiently rich (e.g., chaotic, generative) to potentially produce configurations where `I_t > m`.
    *   *Necessary Conclusion (L5):* Such systems **must** eventually face internal states where `I_t > m`. This is the **Saturation Condition (L5)**.
*   **Branching:** Systems whose `D` limits `I_t ≤ m` avoid L5. Systems whose `D` allows `I_t > m` inevitably encounter L5.

Conclusion for Section 9: Saturation L5 is a necessary state for sufficiently complex dynamic systems under S-FiniteQ.

### Section 10: Resolution of Saturation (L5) via Cost (S-Cost) leading to SUR

Systems reaching L5 must transition under constraints S-FiniteQ and **Assumption S-Cost (Non-zero update cost)**.

1.  **L5 Condition:** `I_t > m`. Current state unmappable to a single Σ-class.
2.  **Admissible Continuations:**
    *   **Φ_halt:** No valid transition under constraints. System fails.
    *   **Φ_overwrite:** Map to existing `sᵢ`, lose info, pay cost `c`.
    *   **Φ_encode:** Map to sequence/pattern in `Σ^k`, preserve info, pay higher cost (k*c + K-cost).
3.  **Persistence Filter (Condition C2):** We analyze systems that persist (avoid `Φ_halt`).
4.  **Resource Constraint:** Persistent paths must manage the cost budget over time.
5.  **Deduction → Forced Optimization (SUR):**
    *   Persistent systems (C2) must resolve L5 using costly mechanisms (S-Cost) within finite capacity (S-FiniteQ).
    *   *Necessary Consequence:* Persistent trajectories (`Ω_persist`) are those navigating the state space via `Φ_overwrite`/`Φ_encode` such that joint cost `K + E` remains bounded/managed. This set *is* the **SUR dynamic**.

Conclusion for Section 10: SUR emerges as the necessary operating dynamic for persistent, dynamic, finite-distinguishable systems resolving internal saturation under non-zero operational costs. SUR = (F0 from S₀/Ω → S-FiniteQ → S-Carrier → L1 realized → S-Cost → L5 → C2 resolution).

# Technical Appendix B — Self-Consistency Note

**(The Logic and the Loop – How the Analysis Justifies its Own Tools within the derived context)**

We used standard logical analysis (clear distinctions, consistent steps, parsimony) to deduce that systems satisfying the foundational requirements (forced F0 implying S-FiniteQ, with L1 realized by dynamics under S-Carrier) and dynamic constraints (S-Cost), conditioned on persistence (C2), are forced into the **SUR dynamic**. Does this beg the question by assuming the validity of the logic used?

1.  **The Analytical Tool (Standard Logic):** Relies on clear distinctions, consistent inference, coherent outcomes, efficiency (parsimony).
2.  **The Derived System Dynamic (SUR):** Characterizes the set of persistent trajectories sustainable under the derived and assumed constraints. These trajectories necessarily resolve the L5 saturation condition via mechanisms (`Φ_overwrite`, `Φ_encode`) that balance information fidelity (distinction, coherence) against resource cost (efficiency).

**The Self-Consistent Loop:** The characteristics making standard logic effective (distinction, consistency, efficiency) are precisely those reflected in the structure of trajectories sustainable under the **SUR dynamic**.

*   A system operating within the SUR dynamic inherently favors configurations and transition rules that are representable and executable within the bounds of S-FiniteQ and S-Cost. This favors states amenable to clear distinction, transitions that are consistent (leading to predictable recurrence L1), and encoding schemes (`Φ_encode`) that are efficient (low K and E cost).
*   Standard logic excels at describing systems with such properties (clear states, consistent rules, efficient structure).

Therefore, the use of standard logic finds its justification *internally* for systems within this specific regime. The logic reveals a system dynamic (SUR) whose viable states and transitions intrinsically embody the principles of distinction, consistency, and efficiency valued by that same logic. It's not axiomatic bootstrapping, but **operational self-consistency** driven by the minimal requirements for stable, persistent, information-processing systems under finite constraints, rooted ultimately in the necessary resolution of the S₀/Ω incompatibility and the mathematical consequences of finite dynamics.

**Conclusion for Appendix B:** The validity of using standard logic *within the context defined by the forced emergence of finite distinction and the requirements for persistent dynamics* is affirmed by the derived necessary dynamics (SUR) of that context itself. The analytical tool is appropriate because the system, forced by these minimal requirements, operates in a way that selects for trajectories embodying the very principles inherent in the tool.

- The next step remains to explore the **concrete structural manifestations** driven by this SUR imperative, to verify if the observations in physics and math logically flow from this theory (e.g., emergence of specific conservation laws, gauge symmetries, error-correcting codes, computational universality).
