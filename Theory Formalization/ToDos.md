1. For the dyadic conditional expectation $\mathcal C$ on a type-II₁ factor
  • Linear entropy surrogates ($K$, $C_2$) are contractive/monotone.
  • The signed one-point functional $E(\rho)=\operatorname{tr}(\rho H_0)$ is not monotone: $|E(\mathcal C\rho)|$ can increase.
2. Therefore the ratio $\lambda=C_2/(12E)$ is not an RG Lyapunov function.
3. Monotonicity is recovered if $E$ is replaced by the positive free-energy gap

  is monotone and can still flow to a plateau proportional to $\alpha^{-1}$.
4. The Ledger should henceforth treat $(K,C_2,F_\beta)$ as its primary coordinates; the old scalar $\lambda$ becomes secondary.
5. Geometrically, RG acts as a contact-Hamiltonian flow preserving the 2-form
  $\sigma=dK\wedge dC_2-\mu,dF_\beta\wedge dC_2$; Box 6’s curvature story lifts unchanged.

Part B · Concrete manuscript edits

(Use search-and-replace or rewrite as indicated; keep internal cross-refs coherent.)

LedgerToddBridge.md
• Rename every occurrence of “mean energy $E$” to “free-energy gap $F_\beta$”; keep a one-sentence note that $F_\beta\to E$ in the high-$T$ limit.
• Replace equations (7)–(15) so that $\lambda$ → $\tilde\lambda$ and monotonicity now follows from data-processing of $F_\beta$.
• Delete “Conjecture 4.1” and insert the proved inequality

• Box 5: rewrite the definition of λ so that
  $\displaystyle \lambda=\partial_K F_\beta\big|{\text{SUR min}}=k_BT\ln2$.
• In Tier-12 entry (“Energy analogue”) change wording from “λ = ∂L/∂C” to “Landauer slope set by free energy $F\beta$”.

• Add a sidebar: “If $H_0$ is EM vacuum, plateau $\tilde\lambda_\star(k_BT\ln2)=\alpha^{-1}$ (unchanged).”

• Retitle the old Conjecture 4.1 tasks accordingly.
