5/25 to dos; need to add implications of: 
Theorem (CL-Feasibility).
Let D be any finite device that

(F0) registers at least one concrete distinction A ≠ B, and

satisfies the ledger bound
    K(D) + λ E(D) ≤ L_max   (λ ≡ k_B T ln 2).

Then every admissible inference rule-set implemented by D is bivalent, consistent, and extensionally identical to classical propositional logic.
Put differently: within the feasible region
F = { R | K(R)+λE(R) ≤ L_max },
the only rule-sets are classical ones.

1.  **Starting from Scratch:** We explore what can be logically deduced about *any* possible reality using only the most basic idea imaginable - whether things inside it are different or exactly the same - without assuming any specific physics or inserting any axioms at all
2.  **Logic + Limits Reveal What's Necessary:** By thinking logically about the possibilities and unavoidable limits (like avoiding total chaos or infinite complexity with finite means), we figure out:
    *   What fundamental structures *must* exist (e.g., having distinct internal states, but not infinitely many).
    *   What challenges and behaviors are *forced* upon such structures (e.g., hitting information limits, needing efficient ways to handle information).
3.  **Why Logic Works Here (It Justifies Itself):** The surprising conclusion is that the logical thinking we used isn't just an external tool *we* imposed. The analysis suggests that the very need for systems to operate efficiently and consistently under the deduced limits *mirrors* the core principles of logic itself. In this context, logic becomes a self-consistent way to understand a reality forced to behave logically. As such, this theory avoids the bootstrapping problem.

5.  Part A · Clean findings to incorporate

1. For the dyadic conditional expectation $\mathcal C$ on a type-II₁ factor
  • Linear entropy surrogates ($K$, $C_2$) are contractive/monotone.
  • The signed one-point functional $E(\rho)=\operatorname{tr}(\rho H_N)$ is not monotone: $|E(\mathcal C\rho)|$ can increase.
2. Therefore the ratio $\lambda=C_2/(12E)$ is not an RG Lyapunov function.
3. Monotonicity is recovered if $E$ is replaced by the positive free-energy gap
  $F_\beta(\rho)=\operatorname{tr}(\rho H_N)-\beta^{-1}S(\rho)$, $\beta^{-1}=k_B T\ln2$.
  Both $C_2$ and $F_\beta$ shrink under $\mathcal C$, so
  $\tilde\lambda=\frac{C_2}{12F_\beta}$
  is monotone and can still flow to a plateau proportional to $\alpha^{-1}$.
4. The Ledger should henceforth treat $(K,C_2,F_\beta)$ as its primary coordinates for RG analysis; the old scalar $\lambda$ from $L=K+\lambda E$ remains for base SUR optimization but is secondary for flow dynamics.
5. Geometrically, RG acts as a contact-Hamiltonian flow preserving the 2-form
  $\sigma=dK\wedge dC_2-\mu\,dF_\beta\wedge dC_2$; Box 6’s curvature story lifts unchanged (interpreted on this space).
