## The Two Fundamental Modes of Distinction

At the base of all structure lies a single operation: **distinction**, the act of telling things apart under finite constraint.

There are only **two irreducible ways** to distinguish:
1. **Additive** distinction, which separates by sequence or accumulation  
2. **Multiplicative** distinction, which separates by ratio or internal structure

These generate the two orthogonal axes in distinction space:
- **Δ₊ (Additive):** supports count, time, and ordering
- **Δ× (Multiplicative):** supports structure, symmetry, and composition

All other operations either reduce to these, combine them, or emerge from more complex resolution layers built on them.

## Boundary Elements of Indistinction

- **1** is the boundary of indistinction in multiplicative space. It cannot be factored further and introduces no internal difference.
- **0** is the boundary of indistinction in additive space. It introduces no progression or accumulation.

Together, 1 and 0 define the two structural limits of distinguishability under Δ× and Δ₊. These are the foundational invariants at the edge of expressible form.

|------------------|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Δ₊**           | Additive Distinction      | Produces time, sequence, and count             |
| **Δ×**           | Multiplicative Distinction| Produces form, ratio, and interaction          |
| **C**            | Constraint                | Limits which distinctions are realizable       |
| **Entropy₍Δ₎(x)**| Path Entropy              | Number of distinguishable Δ-paths to x under C |

## Numbers as Path Convergences

A number like **9** is not a fixed entity. It is a convergence point in distinction space, reachable through many Δ-paths.

### Δ₊ paths (Additive):  
These are all additive partitions that reach 9:
- 1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1  
- 3+3+3  
- 2+3+4  

Each path differs in shape, memory cost, and resolution. Additive degeneracy is high.

### Δ× paths (Multiplicative):  
These include all multiplicative constructions:
- 3 × 3  
- 9 × 1  

Multiplicative degeneracy is low. The prime factorization path encodes the recursive structure underlying 9.

## Computational Entropy and Constraint

**Entropy₍Δ₎(9)** is the number of distinguishable ways to construct 9 using Δ₊ and Δ×, given constraint **C**.

Constraint **C** determines which paths are valid. It limits based on cost, depth, modularity, or available memory.

IC tracks the full Δ-path structure of an object, not only the final output. What matters is how the object arises within a constrained distinction system.
