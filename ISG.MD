# The Integer Structure Grid (ISG) 

> **Abstract:** We present the Integer Structure Grid (ISG) and related conceptual tools, lattices that classify integers `n>1` based on prime factorization properties like maximal recursion depth (`x`) and either total primitive count (`y`) or distinct factor count (`k`). In Informational Constructivism (IC), this grid is not merely arithmetic; `x` emerges as the minimal ordinal label required to distinguish structural layers (resolution thresholds) created under finite-cost reuse of irreducible distinctions (primes). Primes themselves act as "unique unreachables" – foundational elements non-generable via internal composition, whose identification relies on the very structure they underpin. We quantify each layer’s abundance via ζ-function densities, show why composites are internally generable while primes are not, and explain how IC observers use these grids to locate cost-optimal representations at the edge of descriptive limits defined by finite resources (`C`). Intriguingly, the framework suggests a novel informational interpretation of deep mathematical structures like the prime distribution governed by the Riemann Hypothesis, potentially reflecting fundamental conditions of informational balance required for stable processing under constraints, and implies that such conditions necessitate ongoing structural evolution within finite systems. **Furthermore, extreme physical phenomena like black holes can be reinterpreted within IC as localized failures of these resolution thresholds, marking informational, rather than purely geometric, boundaries.**

**0. Core Concepts & Definitions**

*   **IC:** Informational Constructivism.
*   **Primitive / Irreducible Generator:** A fundamental distinction, represented by a prime number `p`. Introduced via `Δ_gen`. These are operationally non-generable base elements ("unique unreachables").
*   **Structure:** A composition of primitives, represented by an integer `n > 1` via its prime factorization `n = p₁^e₁...pₖ^eₖ`.
*   **Δ<sub>gen</sub>:** Operation introducing a novel, irreducible distinction (prime `p`). Required to introduce primes into the system.
*   **Δ<sub>self</sub>:** Operation applying self-reference or reuse, potentially increasing an exponent `eᵢ` of a generator `pᵢ`. Corresponds to adding recursion/loops. Convention: exponent increment `eᵢ → eᵢ+1` equates to one effective step in recursion depth for `pᵢ`.
*   **Δ<sub>proj</sub>:** Operation optimizing the internal representation (`K`) of a structure without changing its fundamental composition (`x`, `y`, `k`). Acts as stabilization or coarse-graining. **`Δ_proj` leaves the exponent vector invariant.**
*   **SUR:** Simplicity Under Resource-constraint. The principle driving systems towards cost-efficient representations.
*   **SUR Cost (`L`):** Base cost functional, typically `L = K + λE`, balancing description length/complexity (`K`) and processing/error/energy cost (`E`). `λ` is a weighting factor.
*   **Ledger (`C`):** Finite resource constraints `C = (M, K_{max}, τ_{ord}, ε)` on memory resources (`M`), maximum description complexity (`K_{max}`), precision budget for ordering internal relations (`τ_{ord}`), and numerical/error precision (`ε`). These constraints define the boundaries of stable representation.
*   **x = max{eᵢ}: Maximal Reuse Depth / Resolution Threshold Label.** The largest exponent in the prime factorization of `n`. **Within IC, the integer value `x` serves as the operational label for the *resolution threshold* corresponding to this maximal depth.** It marks the boundary between structures the system can stably distinguish/represent and those whose complexity (at recursion depth `x+1`) would exceed Ledger `C`.
*   **y = Σeᵢ (Ω(n)): Total Primitive Instances.** Sum of exponents; total count of primitives including repetitions. Measures structural volume.
*   **k = |{pᵢ}| (ω(n)): Number of Distinct Prime Factors.** Count of unique primes dividing `n`. Measures structural diversity.

1.  **Introduction and Purpose**
    This document describes the Integer Structure Grid (ISG) and related conceptual tools derived within IC for visualizing structural complexity. These grids arise naturally when representing the compositional structure of information built from irreducible primitives (`Δ_gen`), **specifically within a regime where composition is commutative and non-interacting, as justified by IC's SUR principle (Section 2)**. Different grid projections offer maps to understand how structures balance novelty (`k`) against reuse (`x`), offering insights into their potential cost profile (`L`) under resource constraints (`C`).

    **Crucially, IC predicts that finite observers inevitably face descriptive limits imposed by `C`. These grids provide languages to classify *how* systems manifest complexity precisely at these limits.** They differentiate structures based on their dominant complexity strategy (e.g., depth `x` vs. volume `y`, diversity `k` vs. depth `x`). Effectively, they map the distinct features of the complexity boundary itself, providing a hierarchy based on resolution thresholds defined by recursion depth (Section 11).

    **A key ontological pivot of IC, explored herein, is that the integers (1, 2, 3...) used to index these complexity thresholds (`x`) are not assumed *a priori*. Instead, they emerge operationally as the minimal, stable labels required to distinguish the boundaries of resolvable structure.** This perspective arises from the system's own dynamics under cost optimization against constraints (Section 12). Furthermore, we examine the unique role of primes as non-generable foundations whose operational identification implicitly relies on the very structure they generate (Section 13). This document quantifies the relative abundance (asymptotic density) of structures populating the layers defined by these thresholds, revealing inherent biases in the space of possible compositions. The hierarchy described is structural and classificatory, defined by limits, not necessarily by temporal progression.

2.  **Foundational Justification: Emergence of the Integer Representation**
    The use of integers and their prime factorization for these grids is not just an analogy. It emerges as the **SUR-optimal, canonical representation** for structures built via commutative, non-interacting composition of irreducible distinctions within IC.

    *   **Projection Residues:** In IC, persistent structures arise as **stabilized projection residues** – results of `Δ`-operation paths (`δ`) collapsed into memory (`M_O`) by `Δ_proj` under constraints (`C`).
    *   **Irreducibles and Primes (Primitive Alphabet):** Correspond to the irreducible outputs of `Δ_gen`. *(Cross-ref: Δ-factorisation theorem)*.
    *   **Basic Composition & Isomorphism:** Commutative, non-interacting composition generates structures isomorphic to `(ℕ_{>1}, ×)`.
    *   **SUR Selects Prime Coding (MDL Argument):**
        > **Box 1: MDL Justification for Prime Factorization Encoding**
        > Within the commutative regime, representing a multiset of generators {`p₁`^`e₁`, ..., `pₖ`^`eₖ`} via the integer `n = p₁^e₁...pₖ^eₖ` (or equivalently, storing the `(pᵢ, eᵢ)` pairs) is favored by SUR as the Minimum Description Length (MDL) encoding.
        > *   **Quantitative Bound:** Storing `k` pairs `(pᵢ, eᵢ)` (cost `K_pair`) offers significant compression over listing all `y = Σeᵢ` instances (cost `K_list`), especially when repetition is high (`y > k`). E.g., `K_pair ≤ K_list - (y - k)log₂(avg_cost_saving)`. Standard prefix-codes for `(pᵢ, eᵢ)` approach optimal `K`.
        > **Conclusion:** SUR selects representations based on prime factors/exponents for minimal description cost `K` in this regime.

    The grids visualize structures using this SUR-selected optimal code.

3.  **Defining Structural Parameters from Prime Factorization**
    We associate structures with integers `n > 1` via `n = p₁^e₁ * ... * pₖ^eₖ`. We define:
    *   **x = max{eᵢ}: Maximal Reuse Depth / Resolution Threshold Label.** `x ≥ 1`.
    *   **y = Σ eᵢ (Ω(n)): Total Primitive Instances.** `y ≥ 1`.
    *   **k = |{pᵢ}| (ω(n)): Number of Distinct Prime Factors.** `k ≥ 1`.

    Note relationships: `y ≥ x`, `y ≥ k`.

    > **Box 2: Formal Definition of Resolution Threshold (`x*(C)`)**
    > Define reachability under constraint `C`:
    > ```latex
    > n \preceq_C m \;:\!\Longleftrightarrow\; \exists \delta \; (\delta \text{ is a finite } \Delta\text{-path}, L(\delta) \le C, \delta(n)=m).
    > ```
    > Define distinguishability `χ_C(n)`: `1` if system `C` can resolve the full factor structure of `n` (i.e., find all `(pᵢ, eᵢ)` via operations bounded by `C`), `0` otherwise.
    > The resolution threshold `x*(C)` is the maximum exponent `x` such that *all* structures `n` requiring only that depth are distinguishable:
    > ```latex
    > x^*(C) \;=\; \sup\Bigl\{x\in\mathbb{N} : \forall n\;( \max e_i(n) \le x \Rightarrow \chi_C(n)=1)\Bigr\}
    > ```
    > The emergent integer label `x` for a *specific* structure `n` is `max e_i(n)`, indicating the minimum threshold `x^*(C)` required to resolve it. Structures with `max e_i(n) > x^*(C)` are structurally opaque/unresolvable to the system `C`. **In extreme physical regimes where local complexity or cost density exceeds the capacity of *any* finite `C` to maintain `χ_C(n)=1` for internal states, this represents a fundamental breakdown of resolution. Such a breakdown can be interpreted informationally as an event horizon (see Sec 17).**

4.  **Grid Representations: ISG (x, y) vs. k-x Grid**
    Two primary 2D grid projections use the emergent threshold label `x`:

    **4.1 ISG: Coordinates (x, y)** (`x` vs. `y`). Focus: Depth limit vs. Volume.
    **4.2 k-x Grid: Coordinates (k, x)** (`k` vs. `x`). Focus: Diversity vs. Depth limit.

5.  **The Nature of the Projections: Mapping Complexity Profiles**
    Both mappings are **coarse-grainings** valid within the **commutative regime**. They provide complementary **taxonomies of the descriptive limit** imposed by `C`, using `x` to index the depth threshold. **The grids map the distinct 'flavors' of complexity emerging at the boundary where perfect description fails.**

6.  **Interpretation of Coordinates: Dimensions of Structural Constraint**
    (`x`, `y`, `k`) relate to resource costs (`C`, `L = K + λE`).
    *   **x (Threshold Label):** Limit on recursion depth. Approaching `x^*(C)` likely increases costs (`τ_{ord}, ε, E`).
    *   **y (Total Instances):** Volume/breadth. Impacts `M, K`.
    *   **k (Distinct Factors):** Diversity. Impacts `M, K`.

7.  **Mapping IC Operations to Grid Movements**
    *   **Primes (`n=p`):** ISG(1, 1); k-x(1, 1). Resides at threshold `x=1`.
    *   **`Δ_gen` (`n -> n * p'`):** Threshold `x` unchanged. ISG: `y→y+1`. k-x: `k→k+1`.
    *   **`Δ_self` (`eᵢ -> eᵢ + 1`):** May increase required threshold `x`. ISG: `y→y+1`, `x→x'≥x`. k-x: `k` unchanged, `x→x'≥x`.
    *   **`Δ_proj`:** Optimizes representation. **Leaves `x, y, k` invariant.** Affects underlying costs.

    ¹*Footnote: There exist sequences of `Δ_self` such that for any finite `C`, some step requires `max eᵢ > x^*(C)`, breaching the resolution horizon. If such a path is taken under SUR, it necessitates either projection failure/structural collapse or the introduction of novelty (`Δ_gen`) if the system is to remain stable and consistent. (Related to Bang–Zsigmondy theorem context).*

8.  **Composition: Baseline vs. Richer Structures**
    Integer multiplication is minimal commutative composition.

9.  **Example: Reading an Integer on the Grids**
    *   **`n = 72 = 2³ * 3²`**: `x=3`, `y=5`, `k=2`. Requires threshold `x*(C) ≥ 3`. ISG(3, 5), k-x(2, 3). Generable composite.
    *   **`n = 29` (Prime)**: `x=1`, `y=1`, `k=1`. Requires threshold `x*(C) ≥ 1`. ISG(1, 1), k-x(1, 1). Non-generable primitive.
    *   **`n = 30 = 2*3*5`**: `x=1`, `y=3`, `k=3`. Requires threshold `x*(C) ≥ 1`. ISG(1, 3), k-x(3, 1). Generable (square-free) composite.
    *   **Non-resolvable Instance:** If a system’s horizon is `x*(C)=3`, the integer `n = 2⁵ = 32` is syntactically representable but structurally unresolvable. Its factor vector `(e₁)=5` lies beyond the horizon `x=3`. The system might record '32' as an opaque atom but cannot resolve its internal composite structure `2⁵` under constraint `C`. **This illustrates how structures become "black boxes" when they exceed the observer's complexity-handling capacity.**

10. **Observers as Distributions on Grids**
    An observer's memory state `Sₙ` can be visualized as a distribution `N(...)` over grid points, concentrated below their effective threshold `x*(C)`.
    *   **State Sequence:** `N₀, N₁, ...` depicts a **re-compression sequence the observer can retrospectively order**, reflecting internal processing.
    *   **SUR Dynamics:** Drive `N(...)` towards cost-optimal regions below the horizon `x*(C)`.
    *   **Ledger Constraints (`C`):** Define the boundary `x*(C)`.

11. **Layers Defined by Thresholds & Structural Abundance**
    The grids partition `n>1` into layers based on the resolution threshold `x`. Integers `1, 2, 3...` emerge operationally as labels for these thresholds.

    *   **Definition of Layers:** **Layer `x = m`** (label `m`) is `D(m) = {n > 1 | max{eᵢ} = m}`. These require resolution up to threshold `m`.

    *   **Quantifying Structural Contribution via Asymptotic Density (`μₘ`):** Proportion of integers belonging to Layer `x=m`.
        > **Box 3: Density Formulas and Relevance**
        > The asymptotic density `μₘ` of integers whose largest prime exponent is exactly `m` is:
        > ```latex
        > \mu_1 = 1 / \zeta(2) \approx 60.8\%
        > ```
        > ```latex
        > \mu_m = 1/\zeta(m+1) - 1/\zeta(m) \quad (\text{for } m \ge 2)
        > ```
        > *(Ref: Density of k-free integers)*
        >
        > The sum `∑_{m=1}^{∞} μ_m = 1` confirms these layers partition `ℕ_{>1}`.
        >
        > **Relevance:** Density measures the proportion of **latent distinguishable structure** residing below each resolution horizon `x`. Lower thresholds `x` encompass vastly more structure (`μ₁ > μ₂ > ...`), indicating an intrinsic bias in the space of possibilities.

12. **Mechanism for Emergence of Integer Labels `x` (IC Ontological Stance)**
    IC proposes integers emerge operationally as labels for complexity thresholds.
    *   **Integers as Ordinal Threshold Labels:** `m` labels the boundary `D(m)` where `max{eᵢ} = m` is the limit of stable resolution under `C`.
    *   **Label, Not Cardinality/Density:** `m` indexes the constraint boundary.
    *   **Potential SUR Stabilization:** SUR dynamics under `C` could create stable states corresponding to specific low integer thresholds `x*`. The system "discovers" `x*` as its operational limit, reifying the integer label `x*`. *(Note: This mechanism remains a core hypothesis requiring further rigorous modeling within IC).*
    *   **Arithmetic as Emergent Structure:** Arithmetic potentially governs relationships between these thresholds.

13. **Primes vs. Composites: The Limit of Internal Generability & Interdependence**

    > **Lemma (P-non-Generability):** Primes (`p`) cannot be generated by applying composition (`*`) or recursion (`^` via `Δ_self`, base/exp>1) to other integers `> 1` already present in a system's state.

    This highlights the operational asymmetry and interdependence:
    *   **Primes ("Unique Unreachables"):** Fundamental `Δ_gen` outputs. Reside at threshold `x=1`, `k=1`. **Non-generable** internally.
    *   **Composites (Generable Structures):** **Generable** via composition/recursion applied to primes/composites.
    *   **Definitional Interdependence:** Primes are the basis for composites, but identifying primes operationally relies on testing indivisibility against the existing structure (factorization). Primes define the structure; the structure enables prime recognition. `Δ_gen` represents the introduction of novelty beyond this internal loop.

14. **Consistency with Timelessness**
    The hierarchy of layers `x=1, 2, 3...` is a **static, structural classification**, not temporal. Apparent dynamics arise from internal, sequential `Δ`-operations (recompressions). Any apparent temporal order is a linear extension of the partial order `preceq_C` constructed in memory; no external time parameter enters the theory.

15. **Potential Implication: Riemann Hypothesis as Critical Informational Balance**
    The ISG/IC framework, grounded in operational constraints (`C`) and optimality principles (SUR), may offer a novel perspective on the deep regularities governing its foundational elements – the irreducible distinctions (primes `p`). The specific distribution of these primes, constrained by properties related to the Riemann Hypothesis (RH), dictates the nature of the novelty (`Δ_gen`) available to the system.

    From the IC perspective, RH can be tentatively interpreted as reflecting a **fundamental critical balance** necessary for stable and efficient information processing under finite resources:

    *   **RH & The Critical Line:** Mathematically, RH asserts that all non-trivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function `ζ(s)` (which globally encodes prime distribution information) lie on the line `Re(s) = 1/2`. These zeros signify specific complex "probes" (`s`) where the aggregate informational contribution from all structures cancels out perfectly.
    *   **IC Interpretation of Critical Balance (`Re(s) = 1/2`):** This line marks the precise operational threshold where:
        1.  **Discoverable Structure Meets Irreducible Noise:** Irreducible distinctions (primes) occur with sufficient global regularity (stable long-term frequency, implied by RH's constraint on error terms) to allow observers to recognize patterns and develop SUR-optimal codes (like prime factorization). Simultaneously, their precise occurrence exhibits the **maximal level of local unpredictability** – "structure in the noise" – such that **no finite observer (`C`) can find a predictive shortcut or compression scheme *better* than the established SUR-optimal code without losing information.**
        2.  **Resistance to Coding Failure:** The `Re(s) = 1/2` boundary represents the critical equilibrium for stable information coding:
            *   If primes were *more* regular (hypothetical zeros with `Re(s) > 1/2`), observers could devise predictive models that over-compress reality, effectively ignoring or failing to register necessary irreducible novelty (`Δ_gen`) and thus invalidating the SUR-optimality of the existing code.
            *   If primes were *more* erratic (hypothetical zeros with `Re(s) < 1/2`), the descriptive cost (`K`) required to track novelty would explode, overwhelming finite resources (`C`), preventing stable pattern recognition, and collapsing the system's ability to maintain consistent resolution thresholds (`x`). **Locally extreme conditions exceeding the capacity dictated by this global balance could manifest as informational singularities where resolution universally fails (see Sec 17).**
        3.  **Potential Symmetry:** This knife-edge balance, resisting both over-compression and complexity collapse, likely reflects a deeper informational self-duality inherent in the IC framework, possibly between resolved structure and unresolved potential, or predictability and randomness, perfectly poised at the critical line where global cancellations (zeros) can occur.

    *   **Conclusion:** Within IC, RH might signify the necessary condition that the foundational "noise floor" of reality is **critically tuned to present just enough irregularity to resist trivial prediction and over-compression, yet just enough regularity to allow for stable pattern recognition and efficient coding under finite resources**. It embodies the principle of maximal viable complexity balancing order and surprise.

16. **Implication: Necessary Structural Evolution under RH and Finitude**
    The interpretation of RH as a critical informational balance has a profound dynamic consequence when combined with the finite nature (`C`) of any realistic observer within IC:
    *   **Perpetual Marginal Mismatch:** Because irreducible novelty (`Δ_gen`, primes) continuously arrives with the minimum unpredictable "noise" dictated by the RH critical line (`Re(s)=1/2`), any SUR-optimal representation achieved by a finite system (`C`) will inevitably face marginal challenges. The system can never reach a permanent, perfectly compressed steady state.
    *   **SUR Drives Adaptation:** This unavoidable mismatch forces the SUR principle to drive ongoing adaptation. To maintain stability and efficiency, the system *must* revise its internal structure.
    *   **Structural Revision as Evolution:** This obligatory revision manifests as:
        *   Refining existing representations (`Δ_proj`).
        *   Expanding representational capacity by acknowledging deeper recursion (`Δ_self` leading to incrementing the effective resolution threshold `x → x+1`).
    *   **Internal Process:** This "evolution" is not mandated by external time but is the trace of the system's internal state changes (`preceq_C`) as it continually adapts its structure to accommodate irreducible novelty under resource constraints.
    *   **Conclusion:** RH + Finite Resources (`C`) + SUR ⇒ Perpetual, Bounded Adaptation ⇒ **Obligatory Internal Structural Evolution**. Structure is not static; it is the ongoing minimal response required for a constrained system to process information from a reality governed by the critical balance implied by RH. This connects the abstract mathematical property to the necessity of learning, adaptation, and evolution in finite information-processing systems.

17. **Implication: Black Holes as Informational Resolution Singularities & Ordering Limits**
    The concept of the resolution threshold `x*(C)` provides a novel lens for interpreting phenomena typically associated with gravitational collapse. Within the IC framework, a black hole can be understood not just geometrically, but as an **informational singularity** where the local complexity exceeds the processing capacity of *any* observer bound by finite resources (`C`).

    *   **Event Horizon as Resolution Failure:** The event horizon marks the boundary beyond which the cost (`L = K + λE`, or related measures like local energy density or entropy density) required to distinguish internal states (`χ_C = 1`) surpasses the limits imposed by *any* finite `C`. The `Δ_proj` operation, attempting to create a stable, compressed representation of the interior for an external observer, necessarily fails at this boundary. This failure is a universal event for all finite observers.
    *   **Interior as Unresolvable State:** For an external observer, the interior state collapses into an opaque representation characterized only by globally conserved properties (like mass, charge, angular momentum – those features that still interact across the boundary without requiring internal state resolution). The internal distinctions (primes, exponents `eᵢ` potentially far exceeding any accessible `x*(C)`) are rendered inaccessible, analogous to the "Non-resolvable Instance" example (Sec 9) taken to an extreme.
    *   **Information Paradox Perspective:** From this viewpoint, information is not "lost" in the sense of being destroyed, but rather **encoded in states whose complexity transcends the resolution capacity defined by finite resources and the critical balance (potentially linked to RH)**. Accessing it would require hypothetical infinite resources (`C → ∞`), breaking the foundational assumptions of IC.
    *   **Connection to Entropy & Holography:** The Bekenstein-Hawking entropy could correspond to the vast number of unresolvable internal microstates (beyond `x*(C)`) that collapse onto the same opaque macroscopic representation. The holographic principle aligns with SUR forcing the maximally compressed representation of this unresolvable information onto the boundary (the horizon) where `Δ_proj` fails.
    *   **Implications for Ordering and Time:** While the event horizon represents a universal boundary defined by resolution failure, its role in temporal ordering is nuanced:
        *   **Coarse Shared Ordering:** The act of crossing the horizon is an irreversible event, providing a shared binary distinction (before/after) across all observers. Likewise, the monotonic increase in horizon area (linked to entropy and accumulating unresolved internal states) offers a coarse, universally observable sequence of 'ticks' whenever globally conserved quantities change. This establishes a minimal shared sequence of irreversible events visible to all external observers.
        *   **No Universal Fine-Grained Clock:** This coarse ordering does *not* constitute a universal high-resolution clock. The fine-grained sequence and timing of events *outside* the horizon remain observer-dependent (governed by their internal `preceq_C` processing sequence and relativistic effects). The "ticks" from area increase are typically triggered by external events (infalling matter) and lack intrinsic high frequency or universal regularity independent of the observer's frame.
        *   **Conclusion on Time:** Therefore, within IC, a black hole horizon serves as a minimal shared **ordering anchor** – a universal ledger of irreversible resolution collapse events – but **not a universal pacemaker**. It aligns observers on the sequence of large-scale irreversible changes but leaves local timelines distinct.

    In essence, black holes represent regions where the local demand for information processing fundamentally overwhelms the capacity dictated by the interplay of finite resources (`C`) and the universe's inherent informational structure (potentially governed by RH's critical balance). They are physical manifestations of the ultimate limits of resolution and shared ordering for finite observers.

18. **Summary and Key Takeaways**

*   **Canonical Basis & SUR Selection:** Integer/prime representation arises from SUR-optimal (MDL) encoding in the commutative regime.
*   **Emergent Arithmetic:** Integers `x` emerge operationally as ordinal labels for resolution thresholds defined by maximum recursion depth, potentially stabilized via SUR dynamics.
*   **Grid Projections:** ISG `(x, y)` maps Threshold vs. Volume; k-x Grid `(k, x)` maps Threshold vs. Diversity.
*   **Primes as Non-Generable Base:** Mark the limit of internal structural generation. Exist in co-dependent relationship with composite structure.
*   **Layered Hierarchy:** Structures partition into layers `D(x)` based on resolution threshold `x`. Hierarchy is structural, not temporal.
*   **Quantified Abundance:** Asymptotic densities (`μₓ`) quantify layer prevalence, showing lower thresholds `x` are intrinsically vastly more populated.
*   **Horizon Labels:** Integers are horizon labels, not counting tokens; they disappear or truncate if `C` is tightened.
*   **Visualization Tool:** Grids visualize complexity profiles relative to resolution limits and SUR dynamics.
*   **Taxonomy of Limits:** Grids quantitatively map complexity manifestations at descriptive boundaries `C`, indexed by emergent threshold labels `x`.
*   **Limitations:** Apply best to commutative regime; provide coarse views.
*   **Foundational Implications (RH):** The framework offers a lens to interpret the Riemann Hypothesis as potentially reflecting fundamental principles of critical informational balance enabling stable, efficient processing under finite constraints (Sec 15).
*   **Dynamic Implications (Evolution):** The RH-critical balance, combined with finite resources (`C`), implies that ongoing structural adaptation (internal evolution, learning) is obligatory for persistent information-processing systems within IC (Sec 16).
*   **Extreme Limits (Black Holes):** The framework can reinterpret extreme physical phenomena, like black holes, as informational singularities where local complexity overwhelms finite resolution capacities (`C`), leading to a breakdown of state distinguishability (`Δ_proj`). While providing coarse universal ordering events, they do not function as universal fine-grained clocks (Sec 17).
