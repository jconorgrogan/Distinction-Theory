# Distinction Theory (IC) — Falsifiable Claim Set  
_Claims are grouped by derivation strength._

| Legend | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Core (derived)** | Follows directly from published IC axioms or finished proofs. |
| **Part-derived** | Heuristic proof exists; at least one technical gap remains. |
| **Speculative** | Motivated by IC logic but still a working hypothesis. |

## I. Fundamental Structure

| # | Claim | Status | Falsified if |
|---|-------|--------|--------------|
| 1 | **No universal spacetime.** Space-time structure must be rebuilt by each finite system. | **Core (derived)** | One global metric explains all observations across arbitrary resolution / memory scales with no observer‐specific correction. |
| 2 | **Time is an internal ordering.** Serial order emerges only from finite memory + irreversible updates. | **Core** | Systems lacking any memory/state still exhibit robust, ordered temporal evolution. |
| 3 | **No system accesses actual infinities.** All real structure is finitely distinguishable. | **Core** | A physical device stores or outputs a truly infinite object in practice (not symbolically). |
| 4 | **Entropy = indistinguishability.** Entropy counts configurations the observer cannot tell apart. | **Core** | Two observers with the same resolution limits report different thermodynamic entropy for identical systems. |
| 5 | **Curvature = effort asymmetry.** Observable curvature signals unequal cost to map paths. | **Core** | A system shows curvature while every path-relation cost is empirically symmetric. |

## II. Physics-Specific Predictions

| # | Claim | Status | Falsified if |
|---|-------|--------|--------------|
| 6 | **Stable 3 + 1 spacetime.** Only three spatial + one time dimension lets a self-gravitating quantum register scale. | **Part-derived** | A fully stable, large-N information register is demonstrated in d≠3 spatial dimensions. |
| 7 | **Fundamental constants = compression residuals.** Values like π, α, G arise at “compression walls”. | **Speculative** | A constant’s exact value is derived from a principle unrelated to any finite-compression or stability bound. |
| 8 | **No absolute event horizon.** Horizons are information limits, not universal membranes. | **Core** | Multiple detectors with vastly different constraints locate exactly the same horizon boundary. |
| 9 | **Black-hole images depend on Δ-budget.** Photon-ring geometry drifts at ≥10× data-capacity jump. | **Part-derived** | Next-gen VLBI bandwidth/algorithm boosts show ring size and brightness strictly unchanged beyond noise. |
| 10 | **Hubble tension is methodological.** Early vs. late‐time H₀ split vanishes after identical pipeline depth. | **Core testable prediction** | Full pipeline harmonisation still leaves >5 % mismatch in H₀. |

## III. Quantum & Computation

| # | Claim | Status | Falsified if |
|---|-------|--------|--------------|
| 11 | **P ≠ NP.** Constructive search is fundamentally costlier than verification for finite ledgers. | **Speculative** | A poly-time algorithm solves any NP-complete problem. |
| 12 | **Collapse = resolution limit.** Observer incapacity triggers apparent wave-function collapse. | **Core** | Observers with radically different memory/processing show identical collapse statistics in all regimes. |
| 13 | **Quantum-to-classical scale is observer-set.** Boundary shifts with detector complexity. | **Core** | Same quantum-classical crossover point observed across detectors with orders-of-magnitude capacity gap. |
| 14 | **Quantum Zeno = projection interference.** Rapid measurement freezes change by re-projection. | **Core** | Varying measurement rate has no impact, independent of apparatus resolution. |

## IV. Mathematics & Logic

| # | Claim | Status | Falsified if |
|---|-------|--------|--------------|
| 15 | **Riemann Hypothesis true (stability equivalence).** Finite-ledger stability ↔ RH. | **Part-derived** | A non-trivial zero off the critical line is proven, or an IC-stable model works with RH false. |
| 16 | **Goldbach, twin primes, etc. true.** Constrained randomness of primes allows indefinite recurrence. | **Speculative** | A counter-example disproves any of the listed conjectures. |
| 17 | **No complete computable ToE.** Finite observers ensure any total theory is undecidable/incomplete. | **Core** | A single consistent, computable framework explains every empirical & mathematical fact without undecidables. |

---

## V. Foundational System Dynamics

| # | Claim | Status | Falsified if |
|---|-------|--------|--------------|
| 18 | **Linear SUR cost \(L = K + λE\).** Linearity is forced by additivity + monotonicity + scale invariance. | **Core** | A system obeys those axioms yet provably requires non-linear cost. |
| 19 | **Three primitive operators suffice.** Every operation factors uniquely into {Δ_gen, Δ_proj, Δ_self}. | **Core (formal proof via confluent rewrite)** | Show a physical/computational process that cannot be rewritten into those three primitives. |

---

## VI. Perception & Neuro-implementation

| # | Claim | Status | Falsified if |
|---|-------|--------|--------------|
| 20 | **Identity needs reconstructive memory.** Continuous self requires ongoing integrative recall. | **Core** | An agent with permanently fragmented memory maintains coherent identity indefinitely without re-integration. |
| 21 | **Time perception tracks memory depth.** Richer hierarchical memory alters subjective time granularity. | **Core prediction** | All organisms/machines perceive intervals identically regardless of memory architecture when controlled. |
| 22 | **Dopamine ≈ λE cost signal.** Phasic dopamine encodes prediction-error and salience weighting. | **Speculative / applied mapping** | Experiments show dopamine spikes uncorrelated with error magnitude or salience when these factors are dissociated. |
