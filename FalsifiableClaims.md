## I. Fundamental Structure

### 1. No universal spacetime
> The structure of space and time is not a fixed backdrop but reconstructed differently by systems depending on their resolution and memory.

**Falsified if:**  
A single, global spacetime model accounts for all physical observations across detectors and systems with varying capacities, without requiring adjustments for internal structure.

---

### 2. Time is a constructed internal sequence
> What we experience as time arises from how a system organizes and retains event order internally; it is not fundamental.

**Falsified if:**  
Time ordering appears reliably in systems with no memory, no internal state-tracking, and no causal processing.

---

### 3. No real system can access actual infinities
> Every system interacts only with finite, distinguishable structures; no system can stably handle a truly infinite object.

**Falsified if:**  
Any physical system is shown to store, compute, or generate an actual infinity (e.g., infinite-length output, unboundedly deep hierarchy) in practice—not just symbolically.

---

## II. Physics–Specific Predictions

### 4. Black hole features depend on observer resolution
> Observable features of black holes (like shadow size or ring brightness) vary slightly with the resolution and information depth of the measuring system.

**Falsified if:**  
Increasing the bandwidth, resolution, or reconstruction power of black hole observations yields strictly invariant results across all systems, beyond known noise and uncertainty.

---

### 5. Redshift is not purely physical—it depends on observer processing
> The amount of redshift measured may subtly depend on how the observing system processes the incoming signal—not just on expansion or velocity.

**Falsified if:**  
Redshift–distance curves remain strictly identical across systems with significantly different resolution, bandwidth, or signal-processing capacity.

---

### 6. The Hubble tension is methodological, not physical
> The observed difference in the Hubble constant between early- and late-universe measurements arises from differences in how the data are sampled and processed—not from new physics.

**Falsified if:**  
The discrepancy persists even after both data pipelines are matched in terms of resolution, calibration, and observational depth.

---

### 7. No absolute event horizon
> Whether a region is considered to be “beyond a horizon” depends on what the observer can resolve; the boundary is not fixed.

**Falsified if:**  
A universally consistent, observer-independent horizon is directly observed by multiple systems with very different measurement constraints.

---

## III. Quantum and Computation

### 8. Measurement collapse arises from resolution limits
> Collapse of a quantum system is due to the observer’s inability to resolve all components of a superposition.

**Falsified if:**  
Systems with vastly different memory, processing depth, or resolution produce identical collapse behavior under all conditions.

---

### 9. Quantum Zeno effect is projection-based interference
> Continuous measurement freezes change because it continually reaffirms the same projection, blocking alternative developments.

**Falsified if:**  
Measurement frequency has no effect on system evolution even when the internal structure of the measuring system varies substantially.

---

### 10. Quantum-to-classical transition depends on observer capacity
> The boundary between quantum and classical behavior is not fixed, but varies with the complexity or precision of the observer.

**Falsified if:**  
The classical limit occurs at the same scale across systems with very different measurement configurations and processing power.

---

## IV. Perception and Identity

### 11. Time perception varies with memory depth
> Systems with more recursive or structured memory will perceive and segment time differently from those with limited memory.

**Falsified if:**  
All systems, regardless of memory depth or processing capacity, segment and perceive time identically.

---

### 12. Stable identity requires continuous memory
> A system can only maintain a coherent identity over time if it retains and integrates its own history.

**Falsified if:**  
Systems with fragmented or partially erased memory maintain stable, coherent self-identification over extended intervals without reconstruction mechanisms.

---

## V. Logic and Theory Structure

### 13. No complete theory of everything is possible
> Any theory that claims to fully describe reality will be incomplete or undecidable due to logical constraints and finite observer capacity.

**Falsified if:**  
A single, consistent theory is constructed that fully explains all observed physical and mathematical phenomena without exceptions or unprovable components.

---

### 14. Curvature reflects effort asymmetry
> What we call “curvature” (e.g., in space or state space) is a result of asymmetrical effort or cost in relating distinguishable structures.

**Falsified if:**  
Systems exhibit curvature without any difference in projection effort, computational cost, or resolution asymmetry.

---

### 15. Entropy reflects indistinguishability, not microstate count
> Entropy measures how many configurations are indistinguishable to an observer—not just how many exist.

**Falsified if:**  
Two systems with the same indistinguishability structure yield different entropy values in measurable outcomes.
