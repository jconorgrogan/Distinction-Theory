## Comprehensive List of Falsifiable Claims from Distinction Theory

## I. Fundamental Structure

### 1. No universal spacetime
> The structure of space and time is not a fixed backdrop but is reconstructed differently by systems depending on their internal resolution, memory, and processing constraints.

**Falsified if:**  
A single, global spacetime model accounts for all physical observations across all detectors and systems with varying capacities, without requiring adjustments for the observer's internal structure.

---

### 2. Time is a constructed internal sequence
> What we experience as time arises from how a finite system must serially order irreversible operations to maintain a stable state; it is not a fundamental, external medium.

**Falsified if:**  
Time ordering appears reliably and consistently in systems with no memory, no internal state-tracking, and no capacity for sequential processing.

---

### 3. No real system can access actual infinities
> Every system interacts only with finite, distinguishable structures; no system can stably compute, store, or otherwise realize a truly infinite object or pattern.

**Falsified if:**  
Any physical system is shown to store, compute, or generate an actual infinity (e.g., an infinite-length output, an unboundedly deep hierarchy) in practice—not just symbolically.

---

### 4. Entropy reflects observer-relative indistinguishability
> Entropy measures how many configurations are indistinguishable *to an observer* given its finite resolution—not just an absolute count of all possible microstates.

**Falsified if:**  
Two systems with identical indistinguishability structures (i.e., they can't tell the same sets of states apart) are shown to have measurably different thermodynamic entropy values.

---

### 5. Curvature reflects effort asymmetry
> What we perceive as “curvature” in any space (physical or abstract) is a result of an asymmetrical cost, effort, or number of operations required to relate different structures from an observer's perspective.

**Falsified if:**  
A system exhibits measurable curvature without any corresponding asymmetry in projection effort, computational cost, or resolution between its constituent parts.

---

## II. Physics-Specific Predictions

### 6. Spacetime must be 3+1 dimensional
> Three spatial dimensions and one time-like dimension is the only stable configuration for a scalable, self-gravitating information register that avoids immediate collapse or infinite dispersion.

**Falsified if:**  
A mathematical proof or physical model demonstrates a stable, scalable information-processing system in a different number of spatial dimensions.

---

### 7. Fundamental constants are signatures of system limits
> Constants like α, π, and G are not arbitrary values but are universal "residuals" that emerge when any finite system attempts to perfectly model a symmetric pattern and hits a processing or resolution limit.

**Falsified if:**  
A fundamental constant is definitively derived from a source that has no connection to an optimization process, a system boundary, or a stability criterion.

---

### 8. No absolute event horizon
> Whether a region is considered to be “beyond a horizon” depends on what an observer can resolve; the boundary is not a fixed, physical membrane but an informational limit.

**Falsified if:**  
A universally consistent, observer-independent horizon is directly observed by multiple systems with vastly different measurement constraints, all reporting the exact same boundary.

---

### 9. Black hole features depend on observer resolution
> Observable features of black holes (like shadow size or ring brightness) may vary slightly with the resolution, processing capacity, and information depth of the measuring system.

**Falsified if:**  
Increasing the bandwidth, resolution, or reconstruction power of black hole observations yields strictly invariant results across all systems, beyond known noise and uncertainty.

---

### 10. The Hubble tension is methodological, not physical
> The observed difference in the Hubble constant between early- and late-universe measurements arises from differences in how the data are sampled, calibrated, and processed—not from new physics.

**Falsified if:**  
The discrepancy persists even after both measurement pipelines are matched in terms of resolution, calibration, observational depth, and processing assumptions.

---

## III. Quantum and Computation

### 11. P is not equal to NP
> Finding a solution to a problem (a constructive search) is fundamentally more costly for a finite system than verifying a given solution, reflecting a necessary hierarchy in computational complexity.

**Falsified if:**  
A polynomial-time algorithm for solving any NP-complete problem is discovered.

---

### 12. Measurement collapse arises from resolution limits
> The collapse of a quantum system is caused by a finite observer's inability to resolve and track all components of a superposition, forcing a projection into a single, stable state.

**Falsified if:**  
Systems with vastly different memory, processing depth, or resolution capabilities produce identical collapse behavior under all conditions, showing no observer-dependent effects.

---

### 13. The quantum-to-classical transition depends on observer capacity
> The boundary between where a system behaves quantumly versus classically is not fixed, but varies with the complexity, precision, and information-processing capacity of the observer.

**Falsified if:**  
The classical limit is shown to occur at the same scale and under the same conditions for all systems, regardless of their measurement configurations and internal complexity.

---

### 14. The Quantum Zeno effect is projection-based interference
> Continuously measuring a system freezes its evolution because the measurement process repeatedly forces the same projection, actively interfering with and blocking the system's ability to develop along alternative paths.

**Falsified if:**  
The frequency of measurement is shown to have no effect on a system's evolution, even when the internal structure and resolution of the measuring apparatus vary substantially.

---

## IV. Mathematics and Logic

### 15. The Riemann Hypothesis is true
> The distribution of prime numbers follows the precise regularity described by the Riemann Hypothesis. This is because this specific "critical noise" balance is necessary for a finite system to stably process novelty.

**Falsified if:**  
A mathematical proof finds a non-trivial zero of the zeta function off the critical line, or otherwise disproves the Hypothesis.

---

### 16. Major unproven conjectures in number theory are true
> Conjectures like the Goldbach Conjecture (every even integer > 2 is the sum of two primes) and the Twin Prime Conjecture are true because the "constrained randomness" of primes allows for simple patterns to recur indefinitely.

**Falsified if:**  
A mathematical proof disproves any of these conjectures, for instance by finding a counterexample.

---

### 17. No complete, computable theory of everything is possible
> Any formal theory that claims to fully describe reality will be incomplete or undecidable due to the inherent logical constraints of self-reference and the finite capacity of any observer.

**Falsified if:**  
A single, consistent, and computable theory is constructed that demonstrably explains all observed physical and mathematical phenomena without exceptions or unprovable components.

---

## V. Foundational System Dynamics

### 18. The fundamental cost trade-off is linear
> For any system satisfying basic axioms of cost (e.g., additivity, monotonicity), the trade-off between descriptive complexity (K) and other operational costs like energy (E) is necessarily linear: L = K + λE.

**Falsified if:**  
A system is found that demonstrably obeys the axioms but whose fundamental cost trade-off is provably and irreducibly non-linear.

---

### 19. All operations decompose into three primitives
> Any information-processing act can be uniquely decomposed into a combination of three fundamental operations: generating novelty (Δ_gen), compressing a pattern (Δ_proj), and internal self-reference (Δ_self).

**Falsified if:**  
A fundamental process in a physical, computational, or cognitive system is discovered that cannot be described by a composition of these three operators.

---

## VI. Perception and Consciousness

### 20. Identity requires continuous, reconstructive memory
> A system can only maintain a coherent identity over time if it continuously retains, integrates, and reconstructs a model of its own history.

**Falsified if:**  
A system with a completely and permanently fragmented or erased memory is shown to maintain a stable, coherent self-identification over extended intervals without any mechanism for reconstruction.

---

### 21. Time perception varies with memory depth and structure
> Systems with more recursive or hierarchically structured memory will perceive, segment, and experience the flow of time differently from those with limited or unstructured memory.

**Falsified if:**  
All systems, regardless of memory depth or internal processing capacity, are shown to segment and perceive temporal intervals identically under controlled conditions.

---

### 22. Dopamine's function maps to system cost signals
> The neurobiological function of phasic dopamine in the brain directly corresponds to the error signal (E) and cost-weighting factor (λ) in the system's ongoing process of optimizing its internal model.

**Falsified if:**  
Neurobiological experiments show that dopamine's role is fundamentally inconsistent with tracking prediction error or driving adaptive model updates in response to costly, salient events.
