## 0. Purpose and Scope

This document outlines the current state of formalization for core components of Informational Constructivism (IC), including:
*   The canonical language, state model, and operational definitions.
*   The definition of the base SUR cost functional and key variables for Renormalization Group (RG) analysis.
*   Specific, high-priority target theorems and derivation paths that are currently under development or refinement.

This serves as a reference for ongoing formal work and ensures consistency across the IC research program. Foundational elements like the Δ-Factorisation Theorem and the uniqueness of the linear SUR cost are considered "locked" (see `FoundationalPillars.md`) and form the basis for these ongoing efforts.

## 1. Canonical Language, State, Operators, SUR, and RG Variables (v3.1)

This section defines the core components of an IC system/observer.

### 1.1 Basic Elements
*   **Alphabet (Σ):** A finite set of distinguishable symbols, `|Σ| ≥ 2`.
*   **Payload (w):** A finite string of symbols from Σ, `w ∈ Σ^{≤L_max_payload}` (where `L_max_payload` is a practical limit on raw data segment length).
*   **Record (r):** A tuple `r = (w, n, ...)` where `w` is the payload, `n ∈ ℕ` is a version or instance counter, and `...` may include other metadata like timestamps or context pointers.
*   **State (S):** The observer's current memory content. Modeled as a multiset of records `r`. In a normal-form representation, there might be one primary record per unique payload `w`, with `n` indicating its latest version or a summary of its history.
*   **Handles (M):** A finite list of pointers or indices `M = [h₁, ..., h_{|M|}]` referencing specific records within the State `S`. These ensure that operations can reliably address memory content. Handles are assumed not to dangle.
*   **Code (K):**
    *   The observer's internal model, represented as a prefix-free set of bit strings.
    *   Encodes:
        *   (i) A predictive model `P_K` of the environment and/or internal dynamics.
        *   (ii) An efficient addressing scheme or permutation `π_K` of the State `S` (or parts thereof relevant to the model).
    *   `|K|` (the length of this code in bits) represents the **descriptive complexity cost** (Kolmogorov complexity / entropy cost) of the observer's current model.
*   **Ledger (C):** A tuple representing the observer's finite resource constraints:
    `C = (M_cap, K_cap, τ_cycle, ε_precision)`
    *   `M_cap`: Maximum capacity for handles/addressable memory items.
    *   `K_cap`: Maximum capacity for code complexity `|K|`.
    *   `τ_cycle`: Maximum operational runtime (e.g., number of primitive operations) allowed per processing cycle or for a specific task to be considered "halted" or "completed."
    *   `ε_precision`: Bounds on numerical precision or error tolerance in representations and computations.
*   **Observer (Ω):** The complete IC system/observer, defined by the tuple `Ω = (S, K, M, C)`.

### 1.2 Primitive Operators (Δ-Operators)
These form a minimal, complete basis for IC operations, as established by the Δ-Factorisation Theorem (`01_Core_Axioms_and_Operators/IC_Delta_Factorisation.md`).
*   **Δ_gen (Genesis):** `Ω → Ω'`
    *   Introduces a new, irreducible distinction into the system.
    *   Operationally: Adds a new record to `S` (potentially with a unique payload `w_new`), extends the code `K` to describe/index this novelty, and updates `M` if necessary.
    *   Increases `|K|`.
*   **Δ_proj (Projection/Compression):** `Ω → Ω'`
    *   Stabilizes and compresses information in `S` into a more efficient representation in `K`, under constraints `C`.
    *   Operationally: May permute `S` to an optimal order `π*_K` (e.g., for Kraft-McMillan inequality compliance), rewrite `K` to a shorter, more predictive form, and update `M`. `Δ_proj` is idempotent with respect to its effect on `K` and `P_K`.
    *   Aims to reduce `|K|` and/or improve the efficiency of `P_K`. Acts as the coarse-graining operation in RG analysis.
*   **Δ_self (Self-Reference/Update):** `Ω → Ω'`
    *   Modifies the observer's internal Code `K` (and associated handles `M`) based on its current State `S` and Code `K`. Enables learning, recursion, and model refinement.
    *   Operationally: Arbitrary edits to `K` and `M` that obey ledger constraints `C`. `Δ_self` does not directly alter `S` but changes how `S` is interpreted or predicted by `K`.
    *   Its effect on `|K|` can be variable (increase during learning, decrease during optimization). Axiom S1 (Contractivity) implies that iterative application of `Δ_self` to a specific internal model component will lead to a unique fixed point for that component.

### 1.3 Macros (Examples built from Δ_self)
*   `dup(h_i) := Δ_self[M := M ++ [h_i]]` (duplicates a handle).
*   `drop(h_last) := Δ_self[M := M_new]` (where `M_new` is `M` without `h_last`).

### 1.4 Operational Constraints
*   **Ledger-Respecting Operation:** Any valid IC operation or sequence of operations `F: Ω → Ω'` must:
    *   Halt within `τ_cycle` (if applicable to the operation's scope).
    *   Not violate the capacities defined in `C` (e.g., `|M'| ≤ M_cap`, `|K'| ≤ K_cap`).
    *   Maintain or improve precision `ε'` compared to `ε`.

### 1.5 SUR Cost Functional and Renormalization Group (RG) Variables

*   **Base SUR Cost (Local Optimization):** The unique linear cost functional (see `02_SUR_Dynamics_and_Cost/IC_SUR_Linearity_Proof.md`):
    `L = |K| + λE`
    *   `|K|`: Descriptive complexity cost (as defined above).
    *   `E`: Other operational costs, which can include:
        *   Prediction Error: e.g., cross-entropy `H(P_empirical || P_K)` of the empirical data distribution given the model `P_K`.
        *   Mean Energy: `Tr(ρH_N)` where `ρ` is the observer's state density matrix and `H_N` is an effective Hamiltonian for the unresolved background/bath.
    *   `λ`: Base thermodynamic trade-off rate, fixed by `k_B T ln 2` (Landauer's principle) for systems interacting with a thermal bath at temperature `T`.

*   **RG State Variables (for Scale-Dependent Dynamics):**
    For analyzing how IC systems behave under coarse-graining (`Δ_proj`) across different scales, the following variables, defined for a quantum-statistical description of the observer's state `ρ`, are crucial:
    *   **`K(ρ) = -Tr(ρ log ρ)`:** Von Neumann entropy (corresponds to `|K|` in the classical limit).
    *   **`C₂(ρ) = Tr[ρ(log ρ)²] - K(ρ)²`:** Surprisal variance. Measures fluctuations in information content.
    *   **`F_β(ρ) = Tr(ρH_N) - β⁻¹K(ρ)`:** Free-energy gap relative to the bath `H_N` (where `β⁻¹ = k_B T ln 2 = λ`). `F_β` is monotonic (non-increasing) under relevant coarse-graining operations.
    *   **`λ̃(ρ) = C₂(ρ) / (12F_β(ρ))`:** Candidate monotonic running coupling. Its flow under RG transformations is hypothesized to lead to the emergence of fundamental constants (see `04_Advanced_Topics_and_Applications/IC_Ledger_Todd_Bridge.md`).

*   **RG Flow Dynamics:** The evolution of the system under repeated `Δ_proj` (coarse-graining) is analyzed as a flow on the state manifold parameterized by `(K, C₂, F_β)`. This flow is conjectured to be governed by the gradient of an effective potential related to `λ̃`, driving the system towards fixed points or stable regions.

## 2. Target Proof: Category ΔCat ≅ FdHilb(ℂ) (Dagger-Compact Categories)

*   **Introduced in:** `02_SUR_Dynamics_and_Cost/IC_Operationalizing_Contrast.md` (Tier 7), `01_Core_Axioms_and_Operators/IC_Category_Theory.md`.
*   **Goal:** To formally construct a category, ΔCat, whose objects are IC ledger configurations (or representations of observer states) and whose morphisms are equivalence classes of ledger-respecting Δ-operator sequences. Then, prove that ΔCat is equivalent to the category of Finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces over Complex numbers (FdHilb(ℂ)).
*   **Significance:** This would provide a first-principles derivation of the mathematical framework of Quantum Mechanics from IC's informational postulates.
*   **Key Steps / Lemmas Targeted (based on Selinger 2008, Abramsky-Coecke, etc.):**
    1.  Define objects (e.g., ledger cells/states characterized by `(M, K, τ, ε)` bounds or simplified versions).
    2.  Define morphisms as (equivalence classes of) sequences of Δ-operators that are ledger-respecting and potentially cost-non-increasing (w.r.t. `L` or `F_β`).
    3.  Establish that ΔCat is a symmetric monoidal category.
    4.  Prove ΔCat has duals for all objects (is compact closed), leveraging the reversibility/invertibility properties of Δ-operator sequences where possible and the structure of `Δ_proj`.
    5.  Show ΔCat has a dagger structure (related to informational conjugation or reversal of processes).
    6.  Demonstrate local tomography (states distinguishable by operations).
    7.  Prove purification (any mixed state can be seen as a marginal of a pure state in a larger system).
*   **Current Status:** Outline and conceptual framework exist. Rigorous construction of ΔCat and proof of each prerequisite for the isomorphism theorem (e.g., Selinger's Theorem 7.9 for CPM(FdHilb) or similar results for FdHilb directly) are ongoing. The formalization in `IC_Category_Theory.md` for `Δ_proj` and `Δ_self` as a reflection and an idempotent monad, respectively, is a key step towards establishing the necessary categorical properties.

## 3. Target Derivation Path: Einstein Field Equations (EFE) from SUR Metric

*   **Introduced in:** `02_SUR_Dynamics_and_Cost/IC_Operationalizing_Contrast.md` (Tier 18, Box 6), `03_Derived_Structures_and_Connections/IC_Spacetime_Emergence.md`.
*   **Goal:** To derive the (3+1)D Einstein Field Equations as an emergent consequence of SUR dynamics on the observer's information manifold.
*   **Significance:** This would link gravity directly to information processing under resource constraints.
*   **Proposed Derivation Path:**
    1.  **Information Metric (`g_ab`):** Define a metric on the observer's state manifold. The coordinates of this manifold are related to the key informational ledger variables, likely the RG variables `(K, C₂, F_β)`. The metric `g_ab` is proposed to be the Hessian of an effective SUR cost functional related to `L` or, more likely for dynamic geometry, related to the potential governing the `λ̃` flow or a measure of information distinguishability (e.g., Fisher information metric components).
    2.  **Congruences and Expansion (Raychaudhuri Equation):** Analyze the evolution of congruences (families of paths) of information states on this manifold using a generalized Raychaudhuri equation.
    3.  **Informational Thermodynamics (Clausius Relation):** Employ an IC version of the Clausius relation `δQ = TδS`, where `δS` is related to changes in informational entropy `K` (e.g., `δK`), and `T` is an effective temperature related to fluctuations or the `λ` parameter. The IC Area Law (`S = A k_B / (4ℓ_p²)` from `OperationalizingContrast.md` Box 6, linked via `F_β`/Landauer) would connect `δK` to changes in an effective "area" `δA`.
    4.  **Jacobson-style Derivation:** Combine these elements, arguing that local informational equilibrium implies a relationship between the curvature of the information manifold and the "stress-energy" content (representing the density and flow of information/cost). This aims to yield:
        `R_ab - ½R g_ab + Λ g_ab = κ T_ab`
        where `R_ab` is the Ricci tensor derived from `g_ab`, `Λ` is an emergent cosmological constant (potentially from `λ̃` fixed points or vacuum energy considerations), `κ` is an emergent gravitational constant, and `T_ab` is an effective information stress-energy tensor.
*   **Current Status:** This is a high-level derivation path. Rigorous execution of each step is a major research target. Key challenges include:
    *   Precise definition of the information manifold and its metric `g_ab` from `(K, C₂, F_β)`.
    *   Justification for the emergence of the specific form of `T_ab`.
    *   Derivation of the constants `κ` (related to `G`) and `Λ`.
    *   The statement in `OperationalizingContrast.md` (Box 6 update) that "RG flow... acts on the state space... preserving the 2-form σ = dK ∧ dC₂ - μ dF_β ∧ dC₂" and that "Curvature arises from the Fisher metric associated with (K, C₂) projected along the leaves defined by σ" provides a more concrete direction for defining `g_ab`.

## 4. Refinements and Ongoing Formalization

*   **Rigor of Commutation Lemmas for Δ-Factorisation:** While `IC_Delta_Factorisation.md` is considered "locked," continuous refinement of the semantic proofs for the commutation relations (Lemmas A1, A2, R5) is beneficial.
*   **Monotonicity Proofs for RG Variables (`C₂`, `F_β`, `λ̃`):** Critical for the derivation of constants via `IC_Ledger_Todd_Bridge.md`. Specifically:
    *   Prove general monotonicity of `F_β` under CPTP maps (coarse-graining).
    *   Prove/characterize the monotonic behavior of `C₂` under these maps.
    *   Prove the consequent monotonic flow and convergence of `λ̃` to fixed points `λ̃★`.
*   **CL-Feasibility Theorem (from `IC_ToDos_and_Research.md`):** Formalize and integrate the proof that finite ledger systems under SUR necessarily use classical bivalent logic. This strengthens the "self-consistency of logic" argument.

This document will be updated as these formal targets are achieved or refined.
