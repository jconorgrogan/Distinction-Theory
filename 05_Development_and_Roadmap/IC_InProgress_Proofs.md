## 0. Purpose and Scope

This document outlines the current state of formalization for core components of Informational Constructivism (IC), including:
*   The canonical language, state model, and operational definitions.
*   The definition of the base SUR cost functional and key variables for Renormalization Group (RG) analysis.
*   Specific, high-priority target theorems and derivation paths that are currently under development or refinement.

This serves as a reference for ongoing formal work and ensures consistency across the IC research program. Foundational elements like the Δ-Factorisation Theorem and the uniqueness of the linear SUR cost are considered "locked" (see `FoundationalPillars.md`) and form the basis for these ongoing efforts.

## 1. Canonical Language, State, Operators, SUR, and RG Variables (v3.1)

This section defines the core components of an IC system/observer.

### 1.1 Basic Elements
*   **Alphabet (Σ):** A finite set of distinguishable symbols, `|Σ| ≥ 2`.
*   **Payload (w):** A finite string of symbols from Σ, `w ∈ Σ^{≤L_max_payload}`.
*   **Record (r):** A tuple `r = (w, n, ...)` where `w` is the payload, `n ∈ ℕ` is a version/instance counter.
*   **State (S):** Observer's memory, a multiset of records `r`.
*   **Handles (M):** Finite list of pointers `M = [h₁, ..., h_{|M|}]` to records in `S`.
*   **Code (K):**
    *   Observer's internal model (prefix-free bit strings).
    *   Encodes: (i) Predictive model `P_K`, (ii) Efficient addressing/permutation `π_K` of `S`.
    *   `|K|`: Descriptive complexity cost.
*   **Ledger (C):** `C = (M_cap, K_cap, τ_cycle, ε_precision)` (bounds on memory, code, runtime, precision).
*   **Observer (Ω):** `Ω = (S, K, M, C)`.

### 1.2 Primitive Operators (Δ-Operators)
(Basis established by Δ-Factorisation Theorem)
*   **Δ_gen (Genesis):** `Ω → Ω'` (Introduces irreducible novelty; adds record to `S`, extends `K`, updates `M`; increases `|K|`).
*   **Δ_proj (Projection/Compression):** `Ω → Ω'` (Stabilizes/compresses `S` into `K` under `C`; may permute `S`, rewrite `K`; idempotent on `K`/`P_K`; aims to reduce `|K|`/improve `P_K`; **acts as coarse-graining in RG**).
*   **Δ_self (Self-Reference/Update):** `Ω → Ω'` (Modifies `K`/`M` based on `S`/`K`; enables learning/recursion; arbitrary edits to `K`/`M` within `C`; `|K|` can vary; S1 implies fixed points for components).

### 1.3 Macros (Examples built from Δ_self)
*   `dup(h_i) := Δ_self[M := M ++ [h_i]]`
*   `drop(h_last) := Δ_self[M := M_new]`

### 1.4 Operational Constraints
*   **Ledger-Respecting Operation:** Any valid `F: Ω → Ω'` must halt within `τ_cycle`, not violate `C`, maintain/improve `ε'`.

### 1.5 SUR Cost Functional and Renormalization Group (RG) Variables

*   **Base SUR Cost (Local Optimization):** `L = |K| + λE` (Unique linear form)
    *   `|K|`: Descriptive complexity.
    *   `E`: Other operational costs (e.g., Prediction Error `H(P_empirical || P_K)`, Mean Energy `Tr(ρH_N)`).
    *   `λ`: Base thermodynamic trade-off (`k_B T ln 2`).

*   **RG State Variables (for Scale-Dependent Dynamics):** (Quantum-statistical description `ρ`)
    *   **`K(ρ) = -Tr(ρ log ρ)`:** Von Neumann entropy.
    *   **`C₂(ρ) = Tr[ρ(log ρ)²] - K(ρ)²`:** Surprisal variance.
    *   **`F_β(ρ) = Tr(ρH_N) - β⁻¹K(ρ)`:** Free-energy gap (relative to bath `H_N`, `β⁻¹ = λ`). Monotonic (non-increasing) under relevant coarse-graining.
    *   **`λ̃(ρ) = C₂(ρ) / (12F_β(ρ))`:** Candidate monotonic running coupling.

*   **RG Flow Dynamics:** Evolution under `Δ_proj` (coarse-graining) and `Δ_self` (model update/rescaling) is analyzed as a flow on the `(K, C₂, F_β)` manifold. The canonical "RG step" on structures like the Integer Structure Grid (ISG) is conceptualized as `Δ_proj → Δ_self → Δ_proj`.

## 2. Target Proof: Monotonicity of C₂(ρ) under Coarse-Graining (Δ_proj)

*   **Goal:** To formally prove that `C₂(ρ) = Tr[ρ(log ρ)²] - K(ρ)²` is non-increasing under a coarse-graining operation `Δ_proj`.
*   **Significance:** This is a critical step for establishing the monotonic flow of the running coupling `λ̃ = C₂ / (12F_β)`, which is hypothesized to lead to the derivation of fundamental constants like `α`.
*   **Model for Δ_proj:** A trace-preserving conditional expectation `Φ: A → B ⊆ A` where `A` is a finite von Neumann algebra (e.g., Type II₁ factor as in `IC_Ledger_Todd_Bridge.md`). `Φ` is completely positive (CP), unital, and contractive in the Hilbert-Schmidt norm. Let `σ = Φ(ρ)`.

### Proposed Proof Sketch (Target for Formalization):

1.  **Operator-Jensen Inequality for Convex Functions:**
    For a CP unital map `Φ` and an operator-convex function `f(t)`, it holds that `Φ[f(X)] ≥ f(Φ[X])`.
    The function `f(t) = t²` is operator convex. Applying this with `X = log ρ`:
    `Φ[(log ρ)²] ≥ (Φ[log ρ])²`.
    *Note: The direction of this inequality needs careful handling. Standard operator Jensen for convex `f` is `f(Φ(X)) ≤ Φ(f(X))`. If `f(t)=t^2`, then `(Φ[log ρ])² ≤ Φ[(log ρ)²]`. Let's proceed with this standard form.*
    So, `(Φ[log ρ])² ≤ Φ[(log ρ)²]`.

2.  **Relating `log σ` and `Φ[log ρ]`:**
    Since `σ = Φ(ρ)`, and due to the non-linearity of `log`, `log σ = log(Φ(ρ))` is generally *not* equal to `Φ(log ρ)`. However, for many relevant conditional expectations (like tracing out a subsystem), `Φ[log ρ]` is often related to `log σ` or provides bounds.
    Alternatively, we use the property `Tr[σ f(log σ)] ≤ Tr[ρ f(log ρ)]` for convex `f` if `σ` majorizes `ρ` in a suitable sense after projection, or rely on direct variance properties.

3.  **Variance Decomposition and Trace Properties:**
    We want to show `C₂(σ) ≤ C₂(ρ)`.
    `C₂(σ) = Tr[σ (log σ)²] - (Tr[σ log σ])²`
    `C₂(ρ) = Tr[ρ (log ρ)²] - (Tr[ρ log ρ])²`
    Since `Φ` is trace-preserving, `Tr(σ) = Tr(Φ(ρ)) = Tr(ρ) = 1`.
    Also, `K(σ) = -Tr(σ log σ)` and `K(ρ) = -Tr(ρ log ρ)`.
    The entropy `K(σ) = S(Φ(ρ)) ≥ S(ρ) = K(ρ)` by monotonicity of von Neumann entropy for unital CPTP maps (if `Φ` is unital, which conditional expectations typically are). This means `-K(σ) ≤ -K(ρ)`.

4.  **Direct Approach using Data Processing for Rényi Divergence:**
    `C₂(ρ)` can be related to the second derivative of relative Rényi entropies or free energies.
    Consider `D_α(ρ || τ) = (1/(α-1)) log Tr[ρ^α τ^{1-α}]`. The quantum variance `C₂(ρ)` is related to `-(∂^2/∂α^2) S_α(ρ)|_{α=1}` for Rényi entropy `S_α(ρ)`.
    Rényi entropies `S_α(ρ)` for `α ∈ [0,1] U [1,2]` (exact range depends on details) are known to be monotonic under CPTP maps, i.e., `S_α(Φ(ρ)) ≤ S_α(ρ)` for `α ≥ 1` (entropy decreases or stays same) or `S_α(Φ(ρ)) ≥ S_α(ρ)` for `α ≤ 1`.
    If `S_α(Φ(ρ)) ≤ S_α(ρ)` for `α` in a neighborhood of 1 including values greater than 1, it suggests concavity. The second derivative (related to `C₂`) would be non-positive, and its magnitude might decrease.
    A known result: for a unital CPTP map `Φ`, the variance `Var_ρ(A) ≥ Var_{Φ(ρ)}(Φ(A))` is not generally true.

5.  **Alternative Sketch based on your provided `f(t)=t^2` for Operator Jensen (re-evaluating inequality direction):**
    If Operator Jensen for *convex* `f` is `f(E[X]) ≤ E[f(X)]`, then for `f(t)=t^2` and `E = Φ`:
    `(Φ[log ρ])² ≤ Φ[(log ρ)²]`.
    Taking the trace with `ρ` on the right and `σ` on the left:
    `Tr[σ (Φ[log ρ])²]` (problematic term) vs. `Tr[ρ Φ[(log ρ)²]] = Tr[ρ (log ρ)²]`.

    Let's use the form: `Φ[ (log ρ)² ] ≥ (log Φ[ρ] )²` if `log` were `Φ`-concave and `t^2` decreasing, or other specific conditions. This needs to be carefully chosen from known results.
    A key result (Uhlmann, Ando-Hiai for relative operator entropy) relates to monotonicity: If `f` is operator convex, then `Tr Φ(ρ) f(Φ(A)) ≤ Tr Φ(ρ) Φ(f(A))` for states `ρ` and operators `A`.

    **Revised Sketch based on your input's direction:**
    Assume for operator-convex `f(t)=t^2` and conditional expectation `E`:
    `E[ (log ρ)² ] ≥ (log E[ρ] )²`  i.e. `Φ[ (log ρ)² ] ≥ (log σ)²`.
    Then `Tr[ σ Φ[ (log ρ)² ] ] ≥ Tr[ σ (log σ)² ]`.
    The LHS is `Tr[ Φ(ρ) Φ[ (log ρ)² ] ]`. This is tricky.

    **Let's use the standard result:** For a convex function `f` and a conditional expectation `E`, `E[f(X)] ≥ f(E[X])`.
    Let `X = log ρ`. Then `E[(log ρ)²] ≥ (E[log ρ])²`.
    So, `Φ[(log ρ)²] ≥ (Φ[log ρ])²`.
    `C₂(σ) = Tr[σ(log σ)²] - K(σ)²`.
    `C₂(ρ) = Tr[ρ(log ρ)²] - K(ρ)²`.

    We use `S(ρ) ≤ S(Φ(ρ))` for `Φ` unital CPTP (entropy non-decreasing).
    A more promising approach might be through specific properties of variance under projection or via information-theoretic inequalities related to Fisher Information. The Petz-Sudár relative entropy `D_s(ρ || σ) = Tr[ρ(log ρ - log σ)] - s Tr[(√ρ - √σ)²]` is monotonic.

    **Consider the decomposition from your input:**
    *   Use `f(t)=t^2` as operator convex. Standard Operator Jensen: `f(Φ(X)) ≤ Φ(f(X))`.
        So, `(Φ[log ρ])² ≤ Φ[(log ρ)²]`.
    *   The step `Φ[ (log ρ)² ] ≥ (log E[ρ] )² = (log σ)²` implies `E[X^2] ≥ (log E[exp X])^2` which is non-standard.

    **Using the provided argument's structure directly (assuming its Jensen inequality is correct or adapted):**
    If `Φ[(log ρ)²] ≤ (log Φ[ρ])²` *were* true (this would mean `(log t)^2` is operator *concave* or `t^2` applied to `log` behaves this way, which is unlikely), *then* the argument would flow.
    The standard form is `(Φ[A])^2 ≤ Φ[A^2]` for any operator `A`. Let `A = log ρ`.
    Then `(Φ[log ρ])² ≤ Φ[(log ρ)²]`.
    `Tr[σ (Φ[log ρ])²] ≤ Tr[σ Φ[(log ρ)²]] = Tr[ρ (log ρ)²]`. (since `Tr[Φ(X)Y] = Tr[X Φ*(Y)]` and `Φ*(σ)=ρ` for conditional expectation `Φ` if `σ` is in the image).
    The challenge is relating `Tr[σ (log σ)²]` to `Tr[σ (Φ[log ρ])²]`.
    And `K(σ)²` to `(Tr[σ Φ[log ρ]])²`.

    The argument presented was:
    `Φ[(log ρ)²] ≥ (log Φ[ρ])²`  (call this (*))
    `C₂(σ) = Tr[σ(log σ)²] - K(σ)²`
    `Tr[σ(log σ)²] ≤ Tr[σ Φ[(log ρ)²]]` using (*) and `log σ = log Φ[ρ]`. This means `Tr[σ (log σ)²] ≤ Tr[Φ(ρ) Φ[(log ρ)²]]`.
    This then implies `C₂(σ) ≤ Tr[ρ (log ρ)²] - K(ρ)² = C₂(ρ)` IF `K(σ)²` can be related appropriately.
    Since `S(Φ(ρ)) ≥ S(ρ)` for `Φ` unital, `K(σ) ≥ K(ρ)`. So `K(σ)² ≥ K(ρ)²`.
    Then `C₂(σ) = Tr[σ(log σ)²] - K(σ)² ≤ Tr[ρ(log ρ)²] - K(ρ)² = C₂(ρ)`.
    This requires `Tr[σ(log σ)²] ≤ Tr[ρ(log ρ)²] + (K(σ)² - K(ρ)²)`.
    This proof path hinges on `Tr[σ(log σ)²] ≤ Tr[ρ(log ρ)²]` or a slightly weaker version combined with the entropy increase. This inequality for the `Tr[ρ(logρ)²]` term is known as monotonicity of quantum Fisher information of a certain kind, or related to it.

*   **Key Sub-Tasks:**
    1.  Rigorously establish the correct operator Jensen inequality or related matrix inequality applicable to `Tr[ρ(log ρ)²]` and `(Tr[ρ log ρ])²` under a conditional expectation `Φ`.
    2.  Verify the conditions for strict decrease (e.g., if `ρ` is not a fixed point of `Φ`).
    3.  Explore connections to Lieb concavity, Petz recovery conditions, and non-commutative variance-entropy relations (e.g., `C₂ ≥ 2D(ρ||σ)`) to tighten the argument and understand the magnitude of change.

*   **Current Status:** Plausible proof sketch exists based on assumed operator Jensen inequality behavior. Formalizing this with rigorous matrix analysis is a key next step. The provided sketch in the prompt is a strong candidate.
