Why Δ_gen can be treated as ordinary noise using only IC premises

Finite resources force finite barriers

IC's ledger 
𝐶
=
(
𝑀

𝐾
,
𝜏

𝜀
)
C=(M,K,τ,ε) never allows infinite energy or perfect precision.

A registrar that stores a bit must therefore use a finite barrier 
Δ
𝐸
ΔE; an infinite barrier would violate the energy or precision columns of the ledger.

Finite barriers plus unresolved micro‑structure imply random kicks

The registrar is not isolated. All unresolved micro‑degrees of freedom—whatever the deeper substrate is—constitute an environment relative to the coarse Mode_L description.

Because the observer cannot track those micro states within its ledger limits, their effect enters the Mode_L dynamics as an unmodelled fluctuation term.

This is exactly what statistical mechanics calls "noise". No extra physics is imported; it is a direct consequence of limited resolution.

Fluctuation–dissipation falls out of SUR bookkeeping

Whenever the registrar flips, the ledger records a change in structured information. SUR says the cost 
𝐿
L must balance code length 
𝐾
K against error 
𝐸
E.

Erasing or rewriting that bit later costs at least

 Tln2 (Landauer). The same environment that supplies the flip must be able to absorb that heat; otherwise ledger balance would fail.

A fluctuation strong enough to inject 
Δ
𝐸
ΔE must therefore be tied to a dissipation channel able to carry away 
𝑘

 Tln2. That is precisely the fluctuation–dissipation relation.

The Arrhenius‑like rate is the minimal consequence of 1‑3

A two‑state cell with barrier 
Δ
𝐸
ΔE coupled to unresolved degrees of freedom will satisfy a detailed‑balance condition.

The least structured, ledger‑compatible assumption is that up‑ and down‑rates are proportional to 
exp

(

exp(−ΔE/k

Any other functional form would encode additional structure, increasing 
𝐾
K with no error benefit, violating SUR optimality.

No extra generator is needed

The environment is already there once the system is not described at infinite resolution.

Random kicks are simply the residual influence of that underspecified environment (which can be conceptualized as the vast, unmodeled regions of the total Generative Path Space (GPS) in Mode_R) on the coarse two‑state model.

Therefore Δ_gen is not an extra postulate but the minimal, inevitable by‑product of finite resolution plus finite barriers.
