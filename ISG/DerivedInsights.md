The ISG coordinate system (x, y) arises naturally from the joint operation of the F0 axiom (Registered Contrast) and the SUR cost ledger (L = K + λE). The structure of distinctions generated by Δ_gen and recursively reused via Δ_self leads to a natural classification in terms of maximal reuse depth (x) and total number of primitive distinctions (y). This classification does not require integers or primes to be assumed a priori but arises from the free commutative monoid of irreducibles.

The Integer Structure Grid (ISG) is the unique two-dimensional projection that preserves irreducibility of Δ_gen (x = 1), tracks recursive reuse depth (x > 1), and maintains monotonicity of SUR cost under Δ_proj and Δ_self transformations. Any alternative projection loses at least one of these properties.

The (x, y) projection intentionally discards information about the specific irreducibles used (e.g., prime identities) and the number of distinct generators (k). The minimal injective extension that recovers cost-relevant structure is (x, y, k). This triple is sufficient for modeling the primary drivers of SUR cost when generator diversity contributes to L.

The density of ISG points scales sublinearly with y. Approximate scaling laws follow from classical results in analytic number theory: for instance, the distribution of integers with total prime factor count y behaves like y/log y. The number of points at a fixed y is further restricted by constraints on maximal exponent x.

Intrinsic curvature can be defined within the ISG by computing second derivatives of the SUR cost function L(x, y) with respect to x and y. This yields a cost-based curvature tensor, revealing how steep or flat the cost landscape is around each structural profile.

ISG points where x = y, such as perfect squares, represent structures dominated by recursive application of a single generator. These are interpreted in IC as the maximally symmetric, Δ_self-dominated configurations, with minimal generative entropy and maximal reuse.

The observer's memory state, represented as a distribution Nₙ(x, y) over ISG, evolves over time via Δ_op sequences constrained by the ledger C. This defines a dynamical system governed by SUR minimization, with transitions favoring movement toward lower-cost ISG regions.

The full ISG can be generated using only Δ_gen and Δ_self. Δ_proj is required for optimizing cost but not for reaching new structural points. Under finite τ, the reachable portion of the ISG is a triangular region bounded by constraints on x and y imposed by runtime.

Observer types and cognitive strategies can be classified by their ISG profiles. Low-x observers favor novelty and shallow depth (e.g., parallel, associative cognition), while high-x observers favor recursive reuse and deep modeling (e.g., logic, mathematics). Balanced observers occupy regions where x ≈ y.

The ISG can be lifted to a categorical structure. Structures are objects, Δ operations are morphisms, and recursive reuse paths form homotopy classes. Cohomological structure arises from cycles and fixed points in reuse patterns. This categorical ISG supports topological reasoning about the observer's cognitive process space.

The Riemann zeta function ζ(s) can be expressed in ISG coordinates as a weighted sum over points (x, y), with weights corresponding to the number of structures at each (x, y). ζ(3) corresponds to the first irreducible recursive complexity layer and encodes structures that resist simplification via projection, highlighting a key structural phase transition under the IC framework.

Why These Points Matter

These insights reconstruct the ISG from first principles, showing it is not an arbitrary grid but the minimal coarse-grained structure that preserves the operational dynamics of F0, Δ_ops, and SUR. They formalize how structural distinction, cognitive strategies, and physical cost all project into a unified informational phase space. This unlocks multiple layers of analysis:

A compressed yet expressive observer-centric geometry for structure generation.

A rigorous classification space for observer types, modeling strategies, and memory constraints.

A launchpad for lifting IC into categorical topology, enabling homotopy-theoretic or sheaf-based extensions.

A bridge to number theory, especially the structure of ζ(s), providing a test bed for falsifiable claims (e.g., recursive irreducibility of ζ(3)).

A direct pathway to modeling curvature and RG flows via cost gradients, offering a geometric basis for emergent physical laws (e.g., field equations).
