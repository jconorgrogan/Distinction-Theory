The ISG coordinate system (x, y) arises naturally from the joint operation of the F0 axiom (Registered Contrast) and the SUR cost ledger (L = K + λE). The structure of distinctions generated by Δ_gen and recursively reused via Δ_self leads to a natural classification in terms of maximal reuse depth (x) and total number of primitive distinctions (y). This classification does not require integers or primes to be assumed a priori but arises from the free commutative monoid of irreducibles.

The Integer Structure Grid (ISG) is the unique two-dimensional projection that preserves irreducibility of Δ_gen (x = 1), tracks recursive reuse depth (x > 1), and maintains monotonicity of SUR cost under Δ_proj and Δ_self transformations. Any alternative projection loses at least one of these properties.

The (x, y) projection intentionally discards information about the specific irreducibles used (e.g., prime identities) and the number of distinct generators (k). The minimal injective extension that recovers cost-relevant structure is (x, y, k). This triple is sufficient for modeling the primary drivers of SUR cost when generator diversity contributes to L.

ISG curvature is defined as the Hessian of the cost function L(x, y). Assuming K ∝ y and E ∝ x², the curvature tensor has nonzero components along the reuse-depth dimension: ∂²L/∂x² = 2λβ. This reveals the cost acceleration due to recursion and defines gradient flow trajectories. It also underlies emergent physical field analogues from cost-gradient dynamics.

The density of ISG points scales sublinearly with y, approximately like y/log y. This follows from analytic number theory applied to total prime factor counts. The number of points at fixed y is further constrained by maximum exponent x, shaping the feasible ISG frontier under finite resources.

Δ_gen is not an additional axiom in IC — it emerges necessarily from unresolved microstructure plus finite energetic barriers. The combination of environmental degrees of freedom and discrete stability thresholds injects fluctuations into memory registration, forcing the generation of irreducibles. This makes Δ_gen a thermodynamic inevitability under IC’s core premises.

ISG points where x = y (e.g., perfect powers) correspond to structures dominated by recursive application of a single generator. These points are maximally symmetric, represent minimal generative entropy, and act as recursive attractors. Under recursive reuse, observer distributions tend to drift toward these points due to their efficient SUR profiles.

The observer's memory state can be represented as a distribution Nₙ(x, y) over the ISG. This evolves under Δ_op sequences constrained by C, forming a dynamical system governed by the gradient flow of L. The evolution obeys dN/dt ∝ –∇L(x, y), driving the memory toward low-cost structural regions under finite memory, runtime, and error constraints.

The full ISG is reachable using only Δ_gen and Δ_self. However, Δ_proj is essential for cost minimization, not reachability. Without Δ_proj, structures accumulate redundant representations, and code length K grows without bound. Δ_proj enables refactoring and compression, enforcing ledger-efficient cognition.

Observer types can be classified by their ISG profile. Low-x observers favor novelty and shallow reuse (e.g., associative, parallel processing). High-x observers rely on deep recursion (e.g., formal systems, logical inference). Balanced observers with x ≈ y have efficient, flexible modeling architectures. These regions also correspond to stable attractors under recursive SUR flow.

The ISG can be lifted to a categorical structure, with structures as objects, Δ operations as morphisms, and homotopy classes of Δ_self as higher-order loops. This supports topological reasoning about cognitive process trajectories, recursion fixed points, and memory graph connectivity.

The Riemann zeta function ζ(s) can be rewritten as a partition function over ISG:
 ζ(s) ≈ Σ_{x,y} N(x,y) / [L(x,y)]^s
This structurally encodes the relationship between distinguishability layers and cost. ζ(3), in particular, marks the first layer of recursive irreducibility that resists simplification via Δ_proj, representing a phase transition in structural compression.
